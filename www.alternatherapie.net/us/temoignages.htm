                  <br>
                  For years I suffered relatively heavy bouts of spasmophilia. After undergoing all sorts of "classical" medical treatments, I was placed on sedatives, but I didn't want to become dependent on medication. 
                  Then a friend suggested I go see a magnetist, explaining how my attacks might be energetic in origin. I went to see him and, after just a few sessions, I felt my condition had improved sharply.
                  Today, my attacks are lighter and more infrequent, and I only consult him when the need arises.<br>

                  <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hello, <br>
  I recently met someone who told me I have magnetism. <br>
  My hands get hot and my fingers begin to hurt when I'm around a sick person. <br>
  Is there a way to test for magnetism, or could you recommend someone who might know? <br>
  Thank you for your help. <br>

  I have two asthmatic children, ages 8 and 13, and I feared for their future. Thanks to our trips to the magnetist, their asthma attacks have
  almost completely stopped, and without medical treatment or major manipulation. <br>

                  <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I stopped smoking last October on a neurologist's orders. I had chronic migraines and family history of cerebral thrombosis on my mother's side. He prescribed zyban and sedatives but it didn't do me any good. 
                  I was still in withdrawal, I still had just as many migraines and, to top it all, I gained 20 lbs. then I went and had a needle stuck in my ear and my craving for cigarettes disappeared like magic!<br>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">hi, unfortunately I have a negative story to share: I accompanied my sister who suffered from back pain to a "magnetist" who gave her a pill and laid hands on her. 
                  her back stopped hurting for a couple hours but the pain came back right away and it turned out that the pill was...an anti-inflammatory! I don't know if magnetism works but obviously there are charlatans out there...<br>

                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hello,<br>
  I went to see a magnetist to cure a bad case of psoriasis on my hands. He made me talk about myself, then held his hand on my forehead for a few minutes. A feeling of warmth began to spread throughout my body, followed by a deep tingling.
  He made me call him back every night for a week and my psoriasis basically went away. I don't know if this was a placebo effect or not, but in any case, it worked for me!<br>
