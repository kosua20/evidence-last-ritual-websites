          <h2 align="center"><strong>Price:</strong> &pound;110,000</h2>
          <p>Situation<br>
            Number 47 is well located within this established cul-de-sac, only minutes from the village amenities and enjoying an open aspect to the rear, with views of Ben Cruachan and Beinn Mheadhonach.</p>
          <p>The village of Taynuilt lies approximately 12 miles to the east of Oban.  It has a number of traditional stores including butcher, grocer, and a Sub-Post Office.  It has a modern doctors' surgery, Police Station, two churches, a hotel, a tea-room and a hairdressers.  Other facilities include a sports field with an all weather pitch, a nine hole golf course and a recently modernised village hall.  It also boasts a highly regarded primary school, whilst secondary education is undertaken at Oban, for which a regular bus service operates.</p>
          <p>The Glasgow to Oban Rail Service stops at Taynuilt Station and the Village is served by the Citylink bus service - connecting villages from Glasgow to Oban.</p>
          <p>The local centre of Oban provides a wider range of shopping facilities as well as professional offices.  The town is the main Caledonian MacBrayne ferry terminal servicing the Inner Hebrides and several of the Outer Hebrides.</p>
          <p>North Argyll is a particularly popular holiday destination and is an area of outstanding natural beauty.  The sea lochs provide not only some of the best sailing waters in Europe, but also contain some of the most historic and interesting diving sites.  The countryside is a mixture of quiet lochs through to the high peaks of Ben Cruachan and beyond and the famous ski centres of Glencoe and Aonach Mhor &ndash; which are within 1&frac12; hours drive. </p>
          <p>Directions<br>
            From the south take the A82 north turning left onto the A85 at Tyndrum, signposted to Oban.  Drive through the villages of Dalmally and Lochawe to Taynuilt.  Just before entering the main village take the left turn towards Brochroy.  Follow down this road and take the right hand turn into Achlonan.  Number 47 is on the left hand side.</p>
          <p>Travelling from Oban and the north, continue through the village of Connel to Taynuilt.  Take the left hand turn into the village and follow the road down past the golf course.  Take the second left hand turn following the golf course into Achlonan. Number 47 is on the left hand side.</p>
