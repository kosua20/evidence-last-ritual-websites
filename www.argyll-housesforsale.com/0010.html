          <h2 align="center"><strong>Price:</strong> &pound;265,000</h2>
          <p>North Connel is a highly desirable and up-market location, close to Loch Etive. The nearest town of Oban is approximately 6 miles distant and offers a wide range of shopping, recreational and leisure facilities. There are churches of various denominations, primary schools, a High School, a medical centre and a hospital. Local amenities can be found at nearby villages of Benderloch and Connel where there are also primary schools and shops. </p>
          <p>Directions<br>
            Travelling from Oban, cross over the Connel Bridge (North West) and then take the first turning on the right. Continue approximately 1/2 of a mile along the road, following the shores of Loch Etive, and turn left into the single-track road at the side of the property Llanbryde. Turncroft can be found on the left hand side of the cul-de-sac.</p>
          <p>Description<br>
            The house was completed approximately four years ago. It was architecturally designed and constructed by a highly regarded local NHBC registered builder. Modern day technology provides a very comfortable, well-insulated and energy-efficient family home. All the windows are double-glazed and it benefits from Calor Gas central heating.</p>
          <p>Other features include good quality wood finishes including internal doors, door surrounds and skirting boards. The kitchen units and sanitary ware are all of high specification, as befitting a property of this quality. </p>
          <p>The rooms are well-appointed and the accommodation could be utilised to suit the successful purchaser&rsquo;s needs. The downstairs accommodation consists of a good-sized lounge, with French doors opening to the dining room/kitchen. This is a lovely room and the hub of the house as there are two sets of patio doors &ndash; one set leads directly out to the garden and the other opens into the garden room. The garden room is integral to the house and offers an additional living area perfectly positioned, overlooking the well-kept gardens and perfect for enjoying the southerly aspect.  There are three bedrooms downstairs. The smallest room is currently used as a sitting room/study and the master bedroom has a lovely shower room. </p>
          <p>The upstairs accommodation was designed to be almost self-contained and it is ideal for a family member who may want a degree of privacy and independence. It has an upper lounge with a bedroom off, a further bedroom, a spacious bathroom and a box room. </p>
          <p>Whilst it has always been used as a family home, there is obvious bed and breakfast potential for someone wishing to earn a small income from the property.</p>
          <p>There are modern, attractive, light fittings throughout. In addition, glazed panel doors and the Velux windows on the upper floor allow good natural light.

It is decorated in neutral and pastel colour schemes and has a mixture of fitted carpets and good quality laminate flooring.</p>
          <p>The property occupies a good-sized, level, plot and is flanked by a driveway at each side continuing around to the rear where the landscaped garden is easily maintained and is a pleasant mixture of chips, coloured slab paths, an ornamental pond and raised flower and shrub beds. The front garden is laid to grass and has attractive shrub borders and is fenced from the road.</p>
