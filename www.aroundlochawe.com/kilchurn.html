				<p><strong>Eyewitness account from a young English couple who spend the night in the ruins of Kilchurn Castle:</strong></p>
				<p>After pitching our tent, I decided to go to the top of the main tower. When I got up there, I felt a presence in the room. I thought it was my friend, so I didn&rsquo;t turn round. Then, slowly, an icy coldness seemed to seep through the thick, stone walls and penetrate the tower, and a pleading, worrying voice whispered: &ldquo;Let me go. Please, help me to rest in peace.&rdquo;  I was frozen to the spot in fear. Then the voice was silent, the temperature went back to normal and I managed to pluck up the courage to turn around&hellip;.but there was nobody there.<br />I quickly went back down again, and found my friend huddled against the wall. She had also heard strange voices which, in her own words, &ldquo;came from another world&rdquo;.<br />We ran away, petrified.</p>
