<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>George Buchanan is an outstanding Renaissance humanist and neo-Latin poet, and a key figure in the educational world in Scotland, France and Portugal. It will concentrate on his many-sided secular poetry, with its exceptional range and vitality, his Psalm Paraphrases, which were read and studied for centuries afterwards, and his tragedies, through which he was responsible for introducing classical tragedy into France. Papers will be given by a wide variety of British and European scholars, and there will be opportunities for discussion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>There will be an excursion on Sunday, 19 January taking in the castle and the Church of the Holy Rude in Stirling, and the obelisk in celebration of Buchanan at Killearn. On the evening of July 17th there will be a performance in the Glasgow University Chapel of the multi-voice settings of Buchanan’s Psalm Paraphrases by the French Huguenot composer Jean Servin, published in Geneva in 1579 and presented in the same year to King James in a de luxe edition.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Accommodation will be available in the Queen Margaret Residences in the West End of Glasgow.</FONT></P>
