			<p>I was looking through my things and I found a note that my friend C wrote when he was still alive. It goes like this :<br />
« how long now i’ve been livin’in in my head ? Too far gone to feel the life around me. Gone, lost in a nightmare of my own design ».<br />
He was really lost, but I know he wanted to get the hell out the Order of the Sacred Cross of Samarie (and especially forget about Eileen Fisher
Boyles), he could not stand it anymore… i cannot believe he committed suicide.<br />
I should maybe organize some kind of group against the OSCS… to warn people about it.<br />
But I was thinking, if we – in this new group – have beliefs and practices in common (I mean if we all fight the OSCS together), wouldn’t that be defined as a sect, also? I don’t know. <br />

			<p>I can’t help it. When I like a new song I just listen to it over and over again, until I cannot listen to it anymore… and then even after a week I continue to listen to it again and again.<br />
I listen on my computer or my record player, I listen on my mp3 player in the park between my breaks, I sing it during my work…. And when I go to sleep, I let the music play with the repeat option on. And even if I try not to every time I find a new great song, I cannot help it. So what the heck is wrong with me?<br />

			<p>I wrote a song last night. It deals with deviances like food addiction and porn, but to a certain extend it deals with unbelievable things that happen behind closed doors, like parents pedophilia. I guess I wrote that because of this song about John Wayne Gacy Jr that I was listening to the other day. <br /><br />

			<p>I don't know if anyone actually reads this blog, I didn’t give the address to anyone. I guess it would be fun if any of my friends read it… but I would rather not tell anyone for the moment.<br />
Anyway, we had a show last night. Hey x hey = heyhey rock !! And right, if I had told my friends about my blog I could thank them for coming - but I didn’t so I won’t thank them. Or rather I’m gonna thank them (“thanxs guys”) but they will never know. Well, they will know because I will tell them personally but they will never see my thanks on this blog.<br />
Or maybe I should just go to bed… why am I writing a blog anyway if no one reads it? If you read this blog, just let me know through myspace (I will have a myspace page pretty soon, as soon as I get some time to sign up + a descent photo to put in my profile). <br />

			<p>A few nights ago Steve and I went out to El Rey Theater. Damn, this theater is a great place.<br />
First we saw a guy from France. Just him on stage with his guitar. The guy was totally hypnotizing the crowd. He lighted some candles and was singing in English with some kind of German accent. That was awesome and the audience was really attentive, which is not that common nowadays. I don’t remember the guy’s name. I should check the El Rey’s website to find out. <br />
Then Jeff Lewis played. The music was good as usual and I definitely like the short stories he tells between songs.
At the end of the show I bought guff #01 by J Lewis which is super cool…the drawings are neat.

			<p>Mirah came for one day last week. She had some kind of job interview in LA. We went to a club where I’m Djing… it was so much fun. She helped me pick music up. All my friends were there too.  I was spinning my tunes and everybody was dancing … awesome.<br />
Then we went back home and talked all night long. It’s weird how well we get along. She understands my fear of falling under any kind of mental domination, my passion for music, my desire to quit my job. And I think I understand what she’s been through in her childhood and the present repercussions and consequences.  It’s a shame we don’t live closer to each other… it is really frustrating or maybe that’s what makes it so intense. <br />

Dude, I love this movie. The Big Lebowski, directed by Joel Coen, 1998. <br />
Stephen and his ultimate LA slackers went bowling the other night, yeeaaaah! You should have seen us making moves in the bowling alley, swinging our balls and getting our strikes ! It was nuts, it was out of time and space, it was hilarious. <br /></p>


<p>Hehe. I heard that the Lebowski Fest will be held in LA beginning of March 2006. Jeff "The Dude" Dowd who is the real-life inspiration for the Dude will even be there.  <br /></p>


<p>Also, my friend Dave gave me the address of a website where you can find a Lebowski quiz. So find out which Big Lebowski character you are !!

			<p>Heya, my stay in Philly and NYC kicked ass. I went to the coolest record store ever. It is called The Marvelous and you find there everything you want: graphic novels, zines, vinyls, new and used CDs…<br /></p>


<p>I heard that the Marvelous features live performances by bands like Cheese on Bread and Cordalene, and that they will soon start hosting a monthly night of live electronic music at Millcreek.<br /></p>


<p>I like this place. I am pissed to miss their anniversary party at the end of the month.<br /><br />
<img src="/stephen/ecrire/images/upload/marvelous.gif" alt="" />
<br />
<br />
There was also this girl, Mirah, who I met at a party in NYC. We talked a lot, she’s super smart and super cute. She told me she may visit sometimes. I hope she does.  <br /></p>

&gt;My friend Jolene took this picture, do you remember ☺ ? There was another one but I can’t get a hold of it… I think we were smiling on the other one. &gt;This one is all blurry and we look a bit weird, but I like it. I thought you might like it too.<br />

			<p>Well, it's been a month. I should take this blog more seriously, maybe!?<br /></p>


<p>The thing is I’ve been working a lot. My schedule is crazy, like 2 shifts a day, 6 days a week. I don’t even know if it’s legal to do that. <br /></p>


<p>I want to stay at home, eat vegan junk food, watch great movies, and really do nothing. I heard that we may have some days off soon because of some work they want to do at the restaurant… yeah that would be great, I really can’t stand it anymore.  Being there reminds me of the time when I was at the OSCS 7/7 - 24/24. It’s some kind of indoctrination and I can’t deal with that anymore… in a way it scares me because it’s like I can’t control anything and everything is forced upon me … catering brainwashing !! But I guess it’s what work is: something that you’re forced to do. <br />
It’s insane how fucked up I am. I mean when I feel controlled, it reminds me of the OSCS and what I’ve been through. <br />

			<p>A bunch of stuff happened last week... my friend Joel came to visit. We wanted to go to a show on Thursday night but got lost and ended up having pizza with strangers in a crappy place. So yesterday night we decided to go to an open mic and see if we would be more lucky.<br /></p>


<p>We made it to the right place and it was fun… I even borrowed a guy’s guitar and played a couple of songs. <br /></p>


<p>I also met a guy from Seattle, his name’s Jack. It’s amazing how he manage to play really loud music on his small red guitar… you know it’s the kind of ukulele guitar that sounds really Hawaiian but this guy put a mic on it with some kind of transformer, like a voice transformer but it’s different, and it sounds so weird. He said he’s going to send me a CD when he goes back to Seattle. <br /></p>


<p>Joel took a picture of him… this guys’ crazy, he seems like out of space, out of time… I don’t know… tell you what, his music is awesome.

			<p>I’ve never wanted to be a waiter, I don’t even know why I end up being a waiter (too lazy to do something interesting I guess) but the fact is that I am a waiter and it sucks… <br />
Velouté of celery with truffles, grilled sea scallops with chives and ginger, braised pig’s trotter with morels …  would you like some bread, may I help you sir, the French farmhouse cheeses are the best madam… noisy pretentious meat eaters!!!<br /></p>


<p>The only positive thing about work is that there is a park near the restaurant and I can rest there during my breaks.  For a brief hour between shifts it all becomes quiet. I lay on the grass and look at the trees… it’s like they’re telling me not to go back to work and stay with them. If only I could quit my job and find a way to just play music.<br /></p>


<p>It reminds me of some lyrics from great lake swimmers: <br />
“Where have you been? <br />
And what have you done? <br />
I've been under the ground <br />
Reading prayers from this old book I found <br />
Under the ground<br />
Saving it up<br />
And spending it all<br />
On moving pictures<br />
Silent films<br />
Moving pictures<br />

<p>The only problem is when you don’t have a car you cannot easily visit friends or go to shows out of town. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to hop trains and to go wherever we want? We would all be hobos hitching free rides from place to place… and it would be a good way to meet new friends too. <br />

<p>This is what appeared in my mailbox when I came back from work today. And right after that my mum called and the first thing she asked was: “ well, where will you be dining out on Valentine’s day, honey?”<br /></p>


<p>Why do my parents always torture me?<br /></p>


<p>I wanted to say “nowhere mum ‘cause you’re son is a looser… and by the way, stop calling me”… but I just answered “I haven’t made plans yet, luv u mum, bye”.<br /></p>

			<p>I read my first post, it’s bullshit. I should just tell my story and explain what I’ve been through and why I feel the urge to talk to someone. And because there’s no one in my life, I guess a blog is better than nothing.<br /></p>


<p>I was raised a catholic, and, like so many other kids in the US, went to church every week. My parents are narrow-minded bigots. I don’t really buy their shit but for some obscure reason I’ve always had some kind of Christian faith.<br /></p>


<p>When I was a teenager, I chose to be straight edge… it seemed to be the right choice: I needed to believe in something and Church didn’t give me the answers I was looking for. I was really into veganism and environmentalism. It was also important to maintain control of my life. So no alcohol, no cigarettes, no drugs, no promiscuous sex sounded right to me.<br />

I knew my ideologies were good but they didn’t take me anywhere:  I wasn’t really in control of my life and I was scared of the future, especially the future of our planet that gets trashed a little bit more every day.   I felt very lost.  So I decided  - well not really ‘decided’, it just happened somehow - to enter the OSCS. <br /></p>


<p>To make a long story short, the OSCS is the acronym for Order of the Sacred Cross of Samarie. It was created by James P. Boyles in 1959 and has been run by his wife Eileen Fisher Boyles since he died.<br /></p>


<p>Anyway they presented the doctrine and founding principles in such ways that, at that time, it seemed like the perfect mix of all my beliefs: prayer, purity, strict abstinence (I had no girl friend anyway), no meat, looking beyond earthly pleasures, blah blah blah… <br /></p>


<p>Just like the effect John the Baptist had on people in his time, the OSCS succeeded in having a great power over me…. But, unfortunately, not in the right way: they just fucked me up! <br />

<br />
A real lobotomy, believe me. I’m glad I’m no longer a part of this. <br /></p>


<p>Watch out for these kinds of groups, they’re looking for you when you are in weakest state. Life can be a bitch.

			It’s my first post, I guess I should talk about me or something personal.<br />
So here’s my blurb: <br />
<br />
- I’m moody and cranky but lovable<br /><br />
- It took me a long time to get to the person I am today<br /><br />
- I have ideas and headaches<br /><br />
- I don’t have any patience for freaks who don’t realize what the world is going through<br /><br />
- I don’t do drugs and music makes me high<br /><br />
- my idol is The Big Lebowski <br /><br />
- my band’s name is ‘hey x hey = heyhey’ <br /><br />
- I like the retro style of the 50’s<br /><br />
- I love green tea, Indian food, and vegan treats<br /><br />
- I like horror movies, especially the ones with zombies<br /><br />
