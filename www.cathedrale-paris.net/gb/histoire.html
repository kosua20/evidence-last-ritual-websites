    <td width="50%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">600 years 
      ago, one of France's most beautiful cathedrals was built in the middle of 
      the Ile de la Cité, the original centre of Paris. It was built in less 
      than two centuries on the initiative of Maurice de Sully, King Louis VII 
      and Pope Alexandre III, the first stone being laid in 1163 and work 
      finishing in 1351. The Notre Dame of the Middle Ages is not as we know it 
      today. As from the 18th century, it was defaced and subjected to all sorts 
      of transformations until it was restored by Viollet Le Duc, whose 
      motivation was to breathe life back into the medieval building, which had 
      practically fallen into ruins at the beginning of the 19th century. Despite the prominent place that it occupies in the 
      history books - don't forget that this was the era that was witness to 
      a flamboyant gothic revival due to the Romantic imagination - this 
      is the architect that can be credited with the conservation of this monument 
      along with its gargoyles.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What I would like to show here is the symbolic code 
  used by the builders of the sacred. It would be wrong to think 
  that the location, orientation and even the decoration were chosen at 
  random according the good taste of some architect or other. Oh no - its 
  layout is a lot more meticulous than that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the symbolic figures prevalent in religious architecture (but requiring a considerable 
knowledge of maths that is far beyond my comprehension :o), cathedrals are 
built according to a truly mystic science. Analysing the space helps to 
shed some light on the subject. The location was not chosen at random. Medieval 
builders were highly conscientious in their study of what is known as <EM>telluric 
lines</EM>. That 
 is why a parallel can be drawn between the vertical symbolism 
  and the three worlds making up the universe. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Allow me to explain: the 
  vertical elevation of the cathedral reproduces the way in which the three 
  levels of the universe are stacked. The crypt symbolises the underworld, the walls 
  and floor represent the living world, and the spires and towers depict heaven, thereby conserving 
  the universal harmony. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the horizontal plane, the architects relied 
  on a system of solar symbols. The choir faces the east (sunrise) and 
  logically has its back to the west, which symbolises the end of time. Similarly, 
  the north side, which lies in the sun's shadow, represents sin and evil, whereas 
  the south side is bathed in light and is devoted to the glory of 
  Christ. </font></p>

<p align="center">Notre Dame still has plenty of secrets in store for the uninitiated. As part of my 
  own quest for wisdom, I've followed in the footsteps of the medieval 
  alchemists on their initiatory journey :o) </p>
<p align="center"> Before you embark on this spiritual adventure, let's define what exactly 
  the alchemical spirit is. We all know about the main principle being 
  to transform metal into gold, the epitome of perfection. At the same time, 
  it involved using human means to find the universal 
  perfection inherent in immortality. </p>
<p align="center">   Alchemists, often denounced as sorcerers, 
  developed a mysterious code. They interpreted the Christian iconography 
  widespread in cathedrals as philosophical allegories. Notre Dame is particularly 
  rich in alchemical symbols. It leads us to the path of wisdom, which 
  begins with a deep understanding of oneself by determining the material to be 
  transmuted. You simply need to study the west side for a 
  better understanding of this rather occult aspect. </p>
<p align="center">   The west side of the cathedral is associated with the three 
  interior rose windows,&nbsp;which describe the initiatory journey of the 
  alchemists, a route outside the cosmic dimension and a path within the 
  human dimension.<br>
   The rose windows actually symbolise the path between the primeval darkness and the 
  completion of the work. Their concentric form conveys the idea of the 
  process of perpetual renewal. </p>

      <p><IMG height=257 src="../images/centrale.jpg" width=200></p>
      <p> Central portal on the west side, whose medallions show the alchemical 
        path.</p>
      </td>
    <td>  To make it easier to understand, you 
      need to start with the central pillar and the statue of Cybele, the Phyrigian goddess of wisdom. She holds two books that might represent 
      the Old and the New Testament. More specifically, the first book, which 
      is open, conveys knowledge via the Texts, and the second 
      book, which is closed, conveys the interior knowledge. This alchemical combination of 
      a spiritual approach and knowledge of the Scriptures 
      leads the novice to wisdom. On the outside, the journey 
      starts from the portal of St Anne, mother of the Virgin, 
      which depicts the birth of Christ. That is why the corresponding south rose 
      window represents Christ as the Architect of the world. We are at 
      the beginning of the path, the origin of the World. This beginning 
      can be associated with the putrefaction of the alchemists, called the black 
      work. It consists of removing the impurities from the material, which in spiritual terms 
      means cleansing the soul.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="center">The journey continues with the portal of 
the Virgin, which represents the time cycle of the seasons and work. 
  The west rose window, on the other hand, portrays the night sky and 
  the synthesis of the work. It therefore consists of spiritualising the material (man 
  in this case) and restoring his soul in the previously cleansed body. 
</p>
<p align="center">Finally, the central portal depicts the 
Last Judgement, the finished work; in other words, the <EM>Great Work</EM>. Its medallions guide us through the 
  steps to be taken. </p>
