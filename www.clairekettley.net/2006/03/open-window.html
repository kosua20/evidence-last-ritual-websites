      <div style="clear:both;"></div><div align="justify">I felt like I couldn’t breathe yesterday, when I closed the blog. My head was buzzing, just like silence and death, and I remembered Alasdair… I needed some air, and headed off to the pub. Mum was lying down, reading. I gave her a cuddle and she gave me that far-away smile, not really looking at me. I’m used to it now, but it does give me cause for regret.<br />I put on a jacket and opened the door. It was raining, and there was a nip in the air. I took a deep breath, just like you do sometimes when you open the window to Mother Nature, with her cleansing air purifying your body and mind.<br />It was warm in the pub, and it had already started to get busy. Further along I saw Connie, leaning on the bar and half-facing the door. She waved at me. It looked like she was alone, and it wasn’t difficult for me to make my way over to her. It was almost as if she had been waiting for me.<br />Ewan pulled me my usual ale, no questions asked. He knows my tastes, and when I’m not around. It’s been a while now since he gave up the meaningless bar banter with me. We have our own codes. He likes to play the dumb servant with me: he serves me in silence, throwing me a smile, a look, a knowing blink of the eyes. Sometimes he gets down on his knees, giving me my pint like a vassal making his offering to a laird, then walks away, doffing an imaginary cap. He looks out for me. He protects me from those chancers who see me as something to pull on a Saturday night, just as if he were my older brother (even though we’re around the same age). We’ve known each other for ages, right back to when we were at school together. Over the years we’ve ignored each other, fought with each other, and then observed each other. Our friendship came about from old daily routines, recurring conversations, dinners that were eventually shared, nearby or far away.<br />We kind of lost touch when I went to university in Edinburgh. He stayed in the countryside, went down the obligatory ‘bad boy’ path, but luckily came out of it without too may cuts and bruises.<br />I met him again when I came back to T., in the pub that I used to go to. It had been three or four years since we had seen each other, but it really was just like old times again. The only difference was that he was now on the other side of the bar. He gave me a warm smile and took me by the shoulders in an act of compassion that went straight to my heart. He knew, of course, about Alasdair…<br />As for Connie, it’s more or less the same story: the school benches, with the girls…notes handed to each other behind the teacher’s back, secrets, fighting then making up again…the scrapes we got into and the daft teenage laughter. She was already a working girl when I left to study, but we kept in touch. When I came back she helped me to find little jobs here and there.<br />That evening, with Connie, I drank while listening to the conversations around me. We discovered the recurring themes, and made bets on the direction the conversation would take. As for sport, after February’s match against France, there was a euphoric harmony that had a calming influence. There was a lively debate in the wake of the anti-smoking law, which had just come into force with us in Scotland. Pub owners were whingeing about it, and I heard more than one customer complain that it was a joke that, and I quote, “you can’t light up without having to go and freeze your balls off on the street”, and that, as far as women were concerned, “you would think that they were on the game, the way they walk up and down the street with a fag in their gub”.<br />Connie nudged my shoulder and I laughed with her.<br />It was funny to open this window. A window where I could hear the noise of the beer taps that never rest, the pints being knocked together, the loud voices, the red faces with their musky breath. Yet, this evening, this was what I was breathing.</div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

I belong to the Scottish nation in a way that’s different from the normal clichés. Without denying the folkloric aspects linked to beer, whisky, bagpipes and haunted castles, I find my Scottish identity through more traditional and introspective aspects. Scotland is a land rich in signs and symbols, and I try my best to draw inspiration from this, so that it really is a part of me. </p>  <p class="profile-link"> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/20783533">View my complete profile</a> </p> </div>
