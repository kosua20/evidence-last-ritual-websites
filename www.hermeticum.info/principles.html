Yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of Ancient Egypt.  It explains that the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration.  From THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration;  the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale.  The vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest &ndash; just as a rapidly moving wheel seems to be motionless.  At the other end of the scale, there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem at rest.  Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of varying degrees of vibration.<br>
									From corpuscle and electron, atom and molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion.  This is also true on the planes of energy and force, which are but varying degrees of vibration;  and also on the mental planes (whose states depend upon vibrations); and even on the spiritual planes.</font></td>

									  <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This Principle embodies the truth that &ldquo;everything is dual&rdquo;; &ldquo;everything has two poles&rdquo;; &ldquo;everything has its pair of opposites&rdquo;;  these phrases are old Hermetic axioms.  It explains the old paradoxes that have perplexed so many, and which have been stated as follows:  &ldquo;Thesis and antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree&rdquo;;  &ldquo;opposites are the same, differing only in degree&rdquo;;  &ldquo;the pairs of opposites may be reconciled&rdquo;;  &ldquo;extremes meet&rdquo;;  &ldquo;everything is, and isn&rsquo;t, at the same time&rdquo;;  &ldquo;all truths are but half-truths&rdquo;;  &ldquo;every truth is half-false&rdquo;;  &ldquo;there are two sides to everything&rdquo;, etc.<br>
									 The Principle of Polarity explains that, in everything, there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that &ldquo;opposites&rdquo; are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with many varying degrees between them. For example:  heat and cold, although &ldquo;opposites&rdquo; are really the same thing;  the differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing.  Look at your thermometer and see if you can discover where &ldquo;hot&rdquo; ends and &ldquo;cold&rdquo; begins!  There is no such thing as &ldquo;absolute heat&rdquo; or &ldquo;absolute cold&rdquo;;  The two terms &ldquo;heat&rdquo; and &ldquo;cold&rdquo; simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that &ldquo;same thing&rdquo; which manifests as &ldquo;heat&rdquo; and &ldquo;cold&rdquo; is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration.  So &ldquo;hot&rdquo; and &ldquo;cold&rdquo; are simply the two poles of that which we call &ldquo;Heat&rdquo;, and the phenomena attendant thereupon are the manifestations of the Principle of Polarity.  The same Principle manifests in the case of &ldquo;Light&rdquo; and &ldquo;Darkness,&rdquo; which are the same thing, the difference consisting of varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena.  Where does &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; leave off, and &ldquo;light&rdquo; begin?  What is the difference between &ldquo;Large and Small&rdquo;? Between &ldquo;Hard and Soft&rdquo;? Between &ldquo;Black and White&rdquo;? Between &ldquo;Sharp and Dull&rdquo;?  Between &ldquo;Noise and Quiet&rdquo;? Between &ldquo;High and Low&rdquo;? Between &ldquo;Positive and Negative&rdquo;?<br>
The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes and no other Principle can supersede it.  The same Principle operates on the Mental Plane.  Let us take a radical and extreme example &ndash; that of &ldquo;Love and Hate,&rdquo; two mental states apparently totally different.  And yet there are degrees of Hate and degrees of Love;  and a middle point in which we use the terms &ldquo;Like&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dislike,&rdquo; which shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss to know whether we &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;dislike&rdquo; or &ldquo;neither&rdquo;.  These opposing sentiments are simply different degrees of the same thing.</font></p>

									There is always an action and a reaction, an advance and a retreat, a maximum and a minimum.  This is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind, energy, and matter. This law is manifest in the creation and destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the life of all things; and finally in the mental states of Man;  it is with this latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most important.  This Principle and the Principle of Polarity, and the methods for overcoming them, for neutralizing them, have been minutely studied by the Hermetists, and using them forms an important part of the Hermetic Mental Alchemy.</font>

									  The Hermetists understand the art and methods of rising above the ordinary plane of Cause and Effect, to a certain degree.  By mentally rising to a higher plane they become Causers instead of Effects.  The masses of people meekly let themselves be carried along,  obedient to environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than themselves; heredity; suggestion; and other outward causes moving them about like pawns on the Chessboard of Life.  But the Masters, rising to the plane above, dominate their moods, characters, qualities, and powers, as well as the environment surrounding them;  they become Movers instead of pawns.  They help to play the game of life, instead of being played and moved about by other wills and environment. They use the Principle, instead of being its tools. </font><br>
