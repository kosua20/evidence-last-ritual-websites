            <p>Dante Alighieri was born into the minor nobility in Florence, 
              sometime during the second half of May 1265. His mother died 
              when he was only 13, and his father passed away when Dante reached 17. 
              The most important event to mark his early life came in 1274 when he met 
			  Beatrice, a young lady with whom he became smitten and whom he glorified 
              as a symbol of divine grace in <em>La Vita 
              Nuova</em> (literally, "The New Life"), followed later 
              by his most well-known work, the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. 
              Famous for her emblematic first name and for having inspired Dante, Beatrice
			  does not have a specific historical identity, but researchers have identified 
              her as Beatrice Portinari, a young woman of Florentine nobility who died in 
              1290 at the age of 20. If Dante's works are anything to go by, he 
              did not know her; he merely caught a glimpse of her on three occasions without 
              ever speaking to her.</p>
            <p>Not much is known about Dante's education, except that he stayed in 
              Bologna around 1285 to enter higher education. Whatever the case, his works 
              reveal such a level of learnedness that they encompass practically all the knowledge of his era. 
              Dante was particularly influenced by the works of the Florentine philosopher and  
              rhetorician Brunetto Latini, who incidentally is given an important role  
              in the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. He mingled with a number of poets  
              and particularly struck up a friendship with Guido Cavalcanti and Cino 
              de Pistoia. At the time, Florence was one of Italy's most powerful cities, 
			  but it was also divided by power struggles between  
              the supporters of two powerful families, the
              Guelphs and the Ghibellines. Dante was initially loyal 
              to the Guelphs, and in June 1289, he fought alongside Florence's Guelph army 
              at the battle of Campaldino. 
              The Florentines scored a decisive victory over the Ghibellines 
              from Pisa and Arezzo, but the victors 
              soon degenerated into infighting, dividing into "Black Guelphs" and "White Guelphs" - 
              it was actually by siding with the White Guelphs that Dante was later sentenced and exiled. 
              At the time, Dante married Gemma Donati, from a Guelph family holding a very important 
              position in Florence.</p></td>

          <td class="legende" width="688"><p><strong>Political life</strong></p>
            <p>Over the next few years - approximately 1295 to 1301 - 
              Dante started playing an active role in the turbulent political arena in 
              Florence; records dating back to 1295 show that he held several 
              positions within the local government. In particular, in 1300 he was sent 
              on a diplomatic mission to San Gimignano, a small Tuscan village, and the same 
              year, he was given a seat on the council along with five other people  
              as a prior, meaning a magistrate, but he only held the position 
              for two months. The rivalry between the two Guelph factions 
              in Florence stepped up a gear during Dante's term in office.
              The Black Guelphs were against imperial power and looked upon the pope 
              as an ally, whereas the White Guelphs  
              wanted to maintain their independence from both the pope and the emperor. To
              preserve the peace within the city, the council decided to banish the leaders 
              of both factions. But thanks to the intervention of Pope Boniface&nbsp;VIII, 
              the Black Guelph leaders were able to return to Florence, seizing power 
              by the end of 1301. In March 1302, while Dante was part of a delegation 
              to the pope in Rome, the Black Guelphs banished him
              from the city for two years and ordered him to pay a heavy fine. As Dante 
              was unable to pay the fine, 
              he was exiled indefinitely from his home city under pain of death. 
              After this particular episode and right to the end, Dante always felt that he had
			  been deceived by Boniface&nbsp;VIII.</p>
            <p>He spent his years in exile in Verona, as well as other towns in the 
              north of Italy, but we know that he stayed in Paris from 1307 
              to 1309. His political convictions changed and he ultimately embraced 
              the Ghibellines' cause, hoping to see the emergence 
              of a European union governed by an enlightened emperor.</p>
            <p>Dante's political aspirations were rekindled when Henry&nbsp;VII of Luxembourg, emperor of the 
			Holy Roman Empire (1310), arrived in Italy with the aim of placing Italy under his sovereignty. 
			During this period of intense political activity, Dante wrote to several Italian princes 
			and political leaders, urging them to welcome Henry&nbsp;VII and viewing 
			his suzerainty as a means of resolving the acute conflicts between the cities. The emperor 
			died in Siena in 1313, taking with him Dante's newfound hopes. It is probably during 
			Henry&nbsp;VII's time in Italy that Dante penned a treatise in Latin, De Monarchia or "On Monarchy" (c. 1313), 
			which outlines his political philosophy; he continued to support the idea 
			of a complete separation between the Church and the State.</p></td>

            <p>In 1316, the Florentine authorities gave Dante the opportunity to return to the city, 
			but according to terms that were generally reserved for pardoned criminals. Dante violently declined 
			the offer, stating that he would only return to his home city with all the dignity and honours 
			to which he was entitled. As a result, he remained in exile until his dying days 
			and spent his last few years in Ravenna, where he died between the night of 13 to 14 September 1321. 
			Ever since, Ravenna has never parted with his remains, despite the Florentines' wish to see him buried 
			in their city. His home city has nonetheless erected a cenotaph in his memory 
			in the Basilica of Santa Croce.</p></td>
