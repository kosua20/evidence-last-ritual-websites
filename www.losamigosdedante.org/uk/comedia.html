          <td class="legende" width="688"><p><strong>The Divine Comedy</strong></p>
            <p>This poem was written by Dante Alighieri during his exile between 1304 and 1321, or to quote Dante: 
			"Midway through our life's journey / I found myself in a dark wood / For the straight way was lost." This 
			occurred 700 years ago, the year of the great jubilee in Rome, decreed by Pope Boniface VIII. Dante was 
			35 (half of life's journey according to the criteria of the time), and it was in spring (Easter time) in the year 1300 
			that Dante undertook his journey into the hereafter.</p>
			<p>Entitled <em>Comédia</em> by its author (in relation to the work, since the ending is happy but the 
			beginning is not), and named <em>Divina 
              Commedia</em> by a Venetian publisher, Ludovico Dolce, Dante's masterpiece 
			  (started around 1304 and finished around 1321) comprises 14 233 verses, composed of triplets (tertiary rhyme), 
			  grouped into 100 cantos divided into three parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em><a href="#dc1">Hell</a></em> from 1304 to 1307 (1 general introduction + 33 
                cantos)</li>
              <li><em><a href="#dc2">Purgatory</a></em> from 1307 to 1313 (33 cantos)</li>
              <li><em><a href="#dc3">Paradise</a></em> from 1316 to 1321 (33 cantos)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This chronicle soon became famous. The ordinary people, the craftsmen of Tuscany,
              learnt <em>Hell</em> off by heart, and later during his  
              distressing exile, the enlightened Princes summoned 
              Dante to hear him talk about what he called the sacred poem in 
              <em>Paradise</em>. The Florence of Lorenzo the Magnificent  
              in the 15th century dedicated a true cult to Dante. Leonardo da Vinci, 
              Raphael and Michelangelo claimed that Dante was their master and Botticelli shut himself 
              away for 10 years to illustrate each of the 100 cantos. In the 16th century, 
              Francis I and his sister Marguerite founded a Dantesque academy 
              where the <em>Comedy</em> was read every evening. Long after his death, Dante's name 
              was engraved by Paul VI in Florence's baptistery 
              where he was christened. Jorge Luis Borges, in "Nine Dantesque 
              Essays", gave a very appealing commentary on Dante's
              work. Of the hundreds of characters in the <em>Comedy</em>, 
              he retained four: Ulysses, Ugolino of Pisa, Francesca and Beatrice. 
              Dante, heading for <em>Paradise</em>, works on the most Christian book 
              ever penned by a human hand, and according to Borges, the awareness of 
              embarking on a danger-fraught adventure that would leave him wide open to his 
              enemies' vengeance enabled Dante to identify with Ulysses. 
              Dante listens to the adulterous Francesca's tale with infinite sympathy 
              instead of rejecting her, as Borges believes that Dante admires and  
              envies the cursed lovers, Francesca and Paolo, condemned 
              to swirl endlessly in the flames, because theirs was requited  
              love - such was not the case for Dante 
              and Beatrice.</p>
            <p>The work is unusually complex and embraces everything that could be contained inside the human 
			mind and which struck Dante's contemporaries  
              by its youthful, vigorous and forthright language. The structure of the 
              comedy is clearly based on the number 3, which expresses the  
              Holy Trinity, and the number 10, which is a perfect number (Beatrice arrives
              in canto XXX of Purgatory and pronounces Dante's name in verse
              73). It tells of a fantastic journey through the hereafter during 
			  holy week in 1300 by Dante himself, lost midway
              through his life's journey in the dark wood 
              of sin and saved from danger by the blessed Beatrice's intercession 
              and accomplishing a life-saving pilgrimage in the next world, 
              guided first by Virgil (the great Roman poet who symbolised 
              human reason) through <em>Hell</em> and then <em>Purgatory</em>, 
              and then by Beatrice through <em>Paradise</em> (epitomising divine  
              knowledge). Dante's journey has an allegorical meaning 
              and represents the path that man must follow to escape  
              earthly passions and reach the inspiration of moral freedom 
              and faith, a path that leads from instinct and ignorance to 
              the awareness of truth and salvation. Dante presents his 
              conception of the hereafter by means of a supernatural journey  
              leading in turn through <em>Hell</em>, <em>Purgatory</em> and <em>Paradise</em>. 
              After witnessing various mystical processions and phantasmagorical 
              metamorphoses, Beatrice appears before Dante upon entering  
              <em>Paradise</em>, while Virgil slips away discreetly. 
              He continues his journey with Beatrice by ascending to  
              <em>Paradise</em>, represented according to the theories put forward by Aristotle and 
              Ptolemy, and comes face to face with the ineffable vision of God with Saint Bernard 
              as his next guide.</p>			  
            <p>The <em>Divine Comedy</em> ends after philosophical knowledge has been fully integrated
              into the divine truth, love has been elevated to the status  
              of principle of all good and all evil, and political problems have been resolved 
              through the doctrine of the empire's universal and eternal legitimacy.</p>			  
            <p>The <em>Divine Comedy</em> falls within the long line of visions of the hereafter 
              and devotes a large place to the Graeco-Latin tradition. 
              The traveller in the hereafter is surrounded by poets and has a poet's preoccupations. 
              The poem is written as a first-person narrative, but Dante's 
              name is only mentioned once by Beatrice.</p>			  
            <p>The prismatic structure of the speaking "I" is unprecedented and  
              anticipates modern literary research. Dante is the subject of his poem; he is 
              everywhere, but he is not the subject matter. 
              We cannot even give an oversimplified image of the world in the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, 
              but we can outline the order that rules over the description 
              of the three kingdoms of damnation, penitence and beatitude. 
              <em>Hell</em> is home to a moving force, <em>Purgatory</em> 
              a more piercing emotion and <em>Paradise</em> the miraculous 
              triumph of the imagination.</p></td>

            <p align="center"><img src="../pics/inferno.jpg" width="200" height="200"></p>
            <p>Of the three canticles in the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, <em>Hell</em> 
              is the most widely known and the most popular. <em>Hell</em>, situated beneath Jerusalem, 
              is presented as a series of nine concentric circles that become increasingly narrow, 
              the closer Dante gets to the centre. 
              The damned are divided up according to Aristotle's classification of sins 
              (the first circle, Limbo, containing the unbaptised dead, is followed by the lustful, 
              the gluttons, the greedy, the wasters, the wrathful and the slothful; heretics are  
              punished in the 6th circle, the violent in the 7th circle, the fraudulent, 
              seducers and flatterers in the 8th circle, the traitors in the 9th circle with  
              Lucifer, where the circles are also divided into zones). Virgil 
              and Dante descend the circles in <em>Hell</em> one by one. 
              Storms, ice, fire, cruel demons - the deeper one goes into sin,  
              the closer one gets to Lucifer and the greater the suffering.</p>
            <p><em>Hell</em> contains the most well-known cantos and famous episodes, 
              such as Francesca da Rimini (canto V) who died for her passionate love affair, with whom the  
              romantics of the 19th century identified (Dante and Beatrice are not the 
              only noteworthy couple in the <em>Divine Comedy</em>). The 2nd circle of Hell, containing the lustful
              and carnal sinners, features Francesca and Paolo, embroiled 
              in a tragedy that is traditionally placed in 1275.</p>
            <p>Francesca da Rimini is married to Giovanni Malatesta, but she is in love with 
              her brother-in-law, Paolo, who returns her love. Giovanni surprises the 
              lovers in each other's arms and murders them. When she meets Dante, 
              Francesca agrees to tell how her love grew: "One day we were reading for our delight / 
              Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral /
              Alone we were and without any fear / Full many a time our eyes together drew / 
			  That reading, and drove the colour from our faces / 
              But one point only was it that o'ercame us / When as we read of the much-longed-for smile / 
              Being by such a noble lover kissed / This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided /
              Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating / 
              Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it / That day no farther did we read therein." 
              Several painters, such as Ingres, 
              have often captured this scene.</p>
            <p>Farinata degli Uberti (X), Pier della Vigna (XIII), Brunetto Latini (XV), Guido Da 
			Montefeltro (XXVIII), Ulysses, who told Dante about his final, fateful journey beyond 
			Hercules' Pillars (i.e. beyond the authorised limits of human knowledge), and the enigma of
			Count Ugolino, victim of a cruel archbishop and possible desperate devourer 
			of his own children, are just some of the characters lining Dante's 
			path.</p>
            <p>Virgil has to climb the fur of the three-headed Lucifer, imprisoned in the ice, 
			to escape hell with Dante clinging on (harrowing episode where Dante sees 
			Judas, the ultimate sinner, already half swallowed head-first by Lucifer's central red head, and 
			Brutus and Cassius, guilty of treason against the Roman Emperor Caesar, their feet 
			sticking out of the mouths of Lucifer's white and black side heads). 
			Virgil has to call on all his power to tear Dante from the pity that he feels for these tormented souls.</p></td>

            <p><em>Purgatory</em>, located on the opposite side of the world from Jerusalem, in the southern 
			hemisphere, looks like a sugar-loaf mountain.</p>
            <p>After crossing the circular shore at its base, the travellers make their way up the mountain 
			via a steep slope, ante-purgatory, a waiting area where sinners atone for both political and 
			religious negligence.</p>
            <p>This is where hope is reborn; lust, wrath, envy and gluttony have brought a humanity here that did 
			not become irrevocably hardened through its faults; this is also where repentance puts the sinners on the path 
			to salvation.</p>
            <p>They then ascend the seven circular terraces carved into the mountainside, 
			each corresponding to one of the seven deadly sins.</p>
            <p><em>Purgatory</em> is populated with political invectives with 
              Cato of Utica, he meets Manfred, the unfortunate heir to  
              Frederick II, the ferocious moral description of the valley of the Arno 
              (XIV), and Hugh Capet's indictment against the French monarchy 
              (XX).</p>
            <p>At the summit of the mountain, Dante encounters Beatrice, ready to guide him through 
			Paradise and who says Dante's name for the first and only time, while Virgil slips away.</p>
            <p>The Beatrice that was once a tenderly beloved mortal now appears with quite a different face: 
			now disembodied, she becomes an allegory, the symbol of truth, a mediating figure like the Virgin,
			without whose help the sinner Dante will be unable to ascend to the kingdom of heaven.</p></td>

            <p align="center"><img src="../pics/paradisio.jpg" width="200" height="200"></p>
            <p>The crux of Dante's major project was actually <em>Paradise</em> - the aim being 
              to show a triumphant Beatrice in the joy of <em>Paradise</em> 
              and to "say of her what was never said of any other woman". 
              <em>Paradise</em> is therefore presented as a form of praise for a woman. It  
              also allows Dante to state his religious beliefs. From the moon to the 
              Empyrean Heaven, via the planets and stars, <em>Paradise</em> 
              comprises nine spheres, including the Celestial Empire where God resides, with each sphere 
              corresponding to a degree of bliss.</p>
            <p>The happiness of the Chosen ones can be measured by the intensity of the light, joy 
              and love that whirl them around in perpetual motion. 
              <em>Paradise</em> never stops moving, and the traveller can only
              detect his own movement by Beatrice's increasingly beautiful face.</p>
            <p>This place of perfect happiness is unbearable, because the reigning emotion, energy and 
			perception are excessive.</p>
            <p>An inner metamorphosis is required to bear the beauty of the  
              Chosen one and the splendour of the Music and Light. Describing
              <em>Paradise</em> is tantamount to surpassing the human element in words. 
              All of <em>Paradise</em> is based on the impossible task of describing
              <em>Paradise</em>. Dante particularly encounters Justinian, Charlemagne and 
              Saint Bernard. The greatest figures in Christendom are there to greet 
              Dante, a potential blessed one. Dante's account includes the eulogy delivered by
              Saint Francis and Saint Dominic, finishing with the harsh denunciation 
              of their unworthy disciples, Dante's meeting with his 
              great-great-grandfather Cacciaguida (just like Aeneas meets his father Anchises 
              in Virgil's Aeneid) who confirms the length of their lineage
              and denounces the moral and political decadence in modern-day Florence. 
              Dante will be subjected to three tests; by Saint 
              Peter concerning faith, by Saint James concerning hope, and by 
              Saint John the Evangelist concerning charity.</p>
            <p>After this celestial procession, Beatrice makes way for  
              Saint Bernard for the final stage. Saint Bernard says a prayer 
              to the Virgin for Dante, before he gazes into 
              the divine light, the last cantos of <em>Paradise</em>, 
              in the most abstract and the purest light rarefaction 
              (O Light Eternal fixed in Itself alone). Dante cannot find the words to 
			  describe the ecstasy that delighted him. These illustrious passages 
              are committed and are not unrelated to the contemporary political reality  
              (local struggles, dynastic conflicts, weaknesses and 
              dishonest compromises of the Church, the fruitless attempts to restore 
              imperial power in Italy with Henry VII of Luxembourg).</p>
            <p>As the <em>Divine Comedy</em> progresses, the political landscape widens from  
              Florence to Tuscany, from Tuscany to Italy, from Italy to 
              Europe, and from Europe to the whole world. Nowhere in his work does Dante 
              give his surname, or the name of his father, mother and children,  
              and note that he is unfamiliar with the vanity of autobiography. 
              The features given to his character are those that make him 
              highly representative of all of mankind in its quest for earthly happiness. 
              The world described by Dante may come across as a long ago world due to its 
              historical and doctrinal content, but it proves to be very 
              present-day on account of its moral substance, its harrowing uncertainty on the brink
              of the future, representing an omen for Dante of an imminent end of time, due to the 
              planetary dimension where it takes place, due to the poetic language of
              unlimited understanding. Dante's work needs to be read in its entirety without stopping 
              at choice sections to understand the tearing of the soul, 
              the anxious wait for great hopes 
              and superhuman elation.</p>
            <p>The general intention behind the <em>Divine Comedy</em> is a man's journey
              towards God, ending with a vision of the Trinity. The teaching of the poem 
              is aimed at everyone and is in keeping with the scholastic philosophy and theology 
              of the 12th and 13th centuries. It is not a theological work,  
              even if Dante happens to be a Christian poet. Dante 
              is also the first to incorporate the Church in the future 
              of human societies and conceive of a story about the Church with episodes of  
              glory and periods marked by crisis.</p>
            <p>He is critical and even lets loose a torrent of abuse against the popes 
			(the episode in his life with Boniface VIII) and forcefully reminds of the absolute 
			asceticism of the primitive Church. Dante loves Florence and never 
			renounced his adhesion to a Guelph community that drove away the Ghibellines. 
			However, Dante sometimes believes that "good living" in society and earthly bliss are just as important 
			as eternal happiness, meaning that he is far from the 
			dominant Augustinian tradition at the time.</p></td>
