            <h2>History and Grand Masters</h2>
            <p><i>The Order of the Hospital was created by Brother Gerard and a few merchants from Amalfi 
			in the middle of the 11th century, as part of a mainly evangelic aim.</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font color="#CC0000">Origins and Organization</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem, the historical protectors of a hospital 
			built in Jerusalem before the first Crusade, were known by the shortened name of Hospitallers or 
			Knights of the Hospital. The order was founded after the creation of the 
			Roman Kingdom in Jerusalem and approved by Pope Paschal II in 1113, followed by Pope Eugene III 
			in 1153. The brothers took the vows of poverty, obedience and chastity, 
			and swore to help defend Jerusalem. Gerard, the first leader, was called the rector; 
			later, the leaders of the order were given the title of Grand Master. As a matter of necessity, 
			the order became a military order and its knights were of noble birth. The order featured 
			three categories of members: knights, chaplains and serving brethren. 
			The knights included the Knights of Justice (title acquired by presenting at least 
			16 degrees of noble lineage) and Knights of Grace (title obtained through merit alone). 
			Serving brothers were responsible for both war duties and administering care in the 
			infirmary. Chaplains were the order's priests. They formed a community subject to the Rule of 
			St Augustine. The order was initially sworn to protecting the pilgrims and crusaders, but subsequently 
			left the Holy Land during the fall of the Crusader States.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font color="#CC0000">The Knights of Rhodes</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>After 1309, the order set up its headquarters on the island of Rhodes. It formed a 
			territorial state and its navy protected the Eastern Mediterranean against the Muslims. 
			The properties belonging to the Knights Templar were offered 
			to the order in 1312. The order's holdings in foreign countries were called "tongues".
			The knights were forced to leave Rhodes in 1522 when the island was besieged by Suleiman the Magnificent, the leader 
			of the Ottoman Turks. It was not until 1530 that they established new headquarters, when Malta 
			was offered to them.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font color="#CC0000">The Knights of Malta</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Now masters of the island, the Knights of Malta (which was the name taken by the order) 
			did a fantastic job defending the island against the besieging Ottoman fleet in 1565. 
			The order remained widely in the European history books until the 19th century. 
			It lost its English and German holdings during the reformation and its French holdings during the 
			Revolution. The Russians then offered their protection to the order, but 
			Malta fell to the French, led by Napoleon. The order moved to Trieste in 1798 and then to Rome in 1834. 
			By then, the Russians had confiscated all of the order's possessions on their land.
			<br>The Knights of Malta, such as recognized by Pope John XXIII in 1961, 
			formed a religious community and an order of knighthood. Organized into five large 
			priories and several national associations, they maintained diplomatic ties with the Vatican 
			and various countries. As a religious community, they had hospitals, first-aid centers 
			and equipment for treating casualties and refugees. 
			They wore a large black cloak bearing the Maltese cross. The Grand Master had the title of prince 
			and held an ecclesiastical rank equal to that of a cardinal.</p>
