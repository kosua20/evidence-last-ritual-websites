            <h2>History and Grand Masters</h2>
            <p><i>Religious and military order founded in the Holy Land during the third Crusade in 1191.</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font color="#CC0000">Origins and Organization</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To give it its full name, the &quot;Order of the Teutonic Knights of St Mary's Hospital 
			in Jerusalem&quot;, the order was originally a simple hospital created by merchants from 
			Bremen and Lübeck during the Siege of Acre (Palestine) in 1191. 
			The Order of the Teutonic Knights was transformed into a military order in 1198 and was 
			officially recognized by the pope in 1199. Closely related to the Curia, it
			modeled its organization on the Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem and included 
			the Templars' techniques in its evangelization process. All the members were of German nobility and 
			wore a white cloak decorated with a black cross. The Rule was enacted in 1244 and listed the 
			hierarchical order of the different members (brother-knights, priests and servants), 
			placing them under the authority of a Grand Master. The Grand Master was elected 
			for life and was assisted by five dignitaries: the Grand Commander, the Marshal, the Treasurer, 
			the Hospitaller and the Quartermaster.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font color="#CC0000">Works</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the 13th century, the order was initially established in the Holy Land 
			before acquiring large swathes of land in the Mediterranean and Germany, where it created 
			12 bailiwicks intended to finance its expeditions. In 1211, the Teutonic Knights 
			migrated to Transylvania and founded the city of Kronstadt (Brasov). In 1231, Grand Master 
			Hermann von Salza responded to the request from Duke Conrad of Mazovia to conquer and 
			colonize pagan Prussia, with the conquest ending in 1283. The order continued to grow through 
			mergers (in 1237 with the Livonian Brothers of the Sword) or takeovers (Eastern Pomerania in 
			1309, Estonia in 1346). In 1329, the Teutonic Knights received the Baltic region stretching 
			from the Gulf of Finland to Pomerania as a papal fief.
			<br>Emperor Frederick II bestowed upon the Order of the Teutonic Knights the status and 
			privileges granted to the Empire's princes. In 1309, the Order set up its headquarters 
			in Marienburg (now Malbork, Poland). The knights erected several fortresses, such as in
			Marienburg and Golub, Prussia. Similarly, they created 93 cities on their lands 
			(such as Königsberg, now Kaliningrad).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font color="#CC0000">Fall of the Order</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Teutonic Knights were increasingly challenged from the end of the 14th century and were 
			defeated at the Battle of Grunwald by Polish King Wladyslaw II Jagiello in 1410, which 
			put an end to their territorial expansion. Heinrich von Plauen, Grand Master from 1410 to 1413, 
			attempted to reform the crumbling order, but was soon ousted by the Chapter. The Thirteen Years' War 
			(1454-1466) between the Poland of King Casimir IV and the Teutonic Knights 
			ended with the return of all the order's territories to Poland, except for Eastern Prussia 
			and Livonia, via the Peace Treaty of Thorn (now Torun) in 1466. In addition, the King of Poland 
			became the overlord of the order's Grand Master for the remaining territories. 
			In the 16th century, Prussia and Courland were secularized and transformed into dukedoms, 
			and Livonia was shared between Poland, Russia and Sweden.
			<br>The Order of the Teutonic Knights survived in southern Germany and underwent something of a revival 
			in the fight against the Turks in Hungary. 
			Disbanded by Napoleon I in 1809, it nevertheless lingered in Austria 
			during the 19th century. In 1918, it was managed by a priest for the first time ever, 
			and in 1929, religious discipline was completely restored. Ever since, except during the Second 
			World War, the Order of the Teutonic Knights (headquartered in Vienna) has been a 
			charity order, whose actions are limited to Austria, Italy and Germany.</p>
