      <p>The <strong>ICPA</strong> is a private association 
    created by friends and colleagues of journalist Jack Lorski in the wake of his murder in 
    Scotland. The ICPA is aimed at helping international police and law departments 
    to bring a swift end to the Phoenix's killing spree.</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p><strong>The case began on October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2003, when Arnaud Ivan, president of SKL Network, received a letter signed "The Phoenix" claiming responsibility for the kidnapping of in-house journalist Jack Lorski and his partner Karen Gijman. The couple (Photo 1) had disappeared eight months earlier while investigating similar murders across Europe. No one yet knows how the incredible story of Europe's most mysterious serial killer since Jack the Ripper began.</strong></p>

On October 8, Arnaud Ivan received a strange black CD-ROM sent by the Phoenix, the contents of which were designed to resemble a video game. Confused by this encrypted program, SKL and the police decided to distribute it to the general public under the name chosen by the kidnapper: In Memoriam.
<br />
<br />
<span class="style2">&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Murder of Professor Peter Volker and the Phoenix Serial Murders</strong>
<br /><br />
Investigators mobilized by the decoding of the CD-ROM learn that Peter Volker, a specialist in ancient languages, who disappeared in 1975, was murdered by professional killers in the pay of a mysterious organization, later revealed to be <em>Manus Domini</em>, an ultra-Catholic secret society charged with defending the interests of the Church. Then they discover that the Phoenix is a <em>serial killer</em> of the worst kind who murdered 12 people between November 2001 and February 2003. All his victims, approached via the Internet, were members of <em>Manus Domini</em>; they were sacrificed coldly, savagely, and cruelly, and the corpses were staged according to an esoteric ritual. Everything was meticulously thought out, prepared, and executed.
<br />
<br />
<span class="style2">&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Numerous references to Giordano Bruno</strong>
<br />
<br />
Investigators initially suspect a Mithra worshipper because "<strong>SOL INVICTUS</strong>" is written near each body. They then understand that the Phoenix refers to Giordano Bruno, a Renaissance philosopher whom he considers his Master; the crime scenes correspond to the stages followed by this Italian thinker during his eventful life, and the macabre scenes refer to the 12 elementary principles of Brunian magic. In fact, the killer has wreaked a double vengeance against Manus Domini: to avenge the death of Peter Volker, for whom the organization is directly responsible, and to avenge the death of Giordano Bruno, unjustly condemned to the stake by the medieval Holy Inquisition, whose resurgence the members of <em>Manus Domini</em> embody.
<br />
<br />
<span class="style2">&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Search for the Nag Hammadi Codex 14</strong>
<br />
<br />
Investigators finally learn that the killer has another goal: to find "Codex 14," a manuscript dating from the first century AD and part of the Nag Hammadi library, discovered by chance in 1945 by an Egyptian peasant. In 1975, Peter Volker possessed this book, and the Phoenix believes that <em>Manus Domini</em> recovered it after the professor's assassination. He therefore tortured the organization's head for Europe, his twelfth victim, to learn where and how to get hold of it.<br />
<br />
In February 2004, the CD-ROM was completely decrypted, and the clues gathered allowed the Milanese police to free Jack and Karen after a particularly trying year of detention. Unfortunately, the Phoenix managed to escape before the police arrived.</li>

<li><span class="style1">Investigation into the murder of Carolina Molikova and the "suicide" of Alex Borgo</span>

After eight months of total silence, the Phoenix made headlines again on October 2, 2004, when it sent a new CD-ROM to SKL. After authentication, this disc was entrusted to Lieutenant Gerd Hanke, the coordinator of Phoenix investigations at the European level. It contained a video shot by Alex Borgo, a young journalist who committed suicide in March 2004, but the other files were encrypted. Given the good results obtained the first time, the police decided to make it public again; it was published under the name suggested by the killer: the Thirteenth Victim.
<br />
<br />
<span class="style2">&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Revelations about Codex 14 and the death of Alex Borgo</em></strong>
<br /><br />
Investigators learn that Alex Borgo (Photo 2), a former lover of Carolina Molikova (the killer's ninth victim), has decided to investigate the true circumstances of his ex-partner's death. Following his investigations in the Czech Republic and Germany, they discover that Carolina only joined the organization to find the Codex 14 that belonged to her great-uncle Thomas A. Malko. The Phoenix informs them that the last three owners of the book were all murdered and accuses <em>Manus Domini</em> of being the mastermind behind these murders. At the end of the CD-ROM, the investigators learn that Alex Borgo has managed to infiltrate <em>Manus Domini</em> and obtain evidence of the organization's criminal activities. The Phoenix then confesses to them that he was forced to assassinate the journalist in order to prevent the publication of this evidence, which could have compromised all his chances of quickly getting his hands on Codex 14.

In April 2006, Jack Lorski (Photo 3) went to Andalusia to film the investigation of a young Spanish detective confronted with the three ritual murders of a <em>serial killer</em>. Three months later, the Scottish police found his horribly mutilated body on the banks of <em>Loch Fyne</em>. The signature of these four murders is identical and immediately brings to mind the Phoenix, although it is significantly different from those he has used until now; this time, the killer removed a limb or organ from the body of each of his victims. The hypothesis of the Phoenix's awakening, after two years of criminal inactivity, was confirmed in early September 2006 by the sending of an encrypted DVD-ROM to Steve Webbing, president of the ICPA. After analysis by the forensic police, its sender was formally authenticated. As with the previous cases, given the complexity of its program, the ICPA and Lieutenant Jeff Mac Evan, head of the investigation, decided to publish this DVD in order to speed up its decryption. It has been distributed since September 21, 2006 under the name that the Phoenix himself wrote on the original: In Memoriam - The Last Ritual.
