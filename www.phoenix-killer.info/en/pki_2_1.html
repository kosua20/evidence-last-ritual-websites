<h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF THE PHOENIX</h2>
<p><strong>David Marcus is a psychologist and criminology expert. Hired by SKL NETWORK, he served as a profiler in the investigation into the kidnapping of Jack Lorski and Karen Gijman.</strong></p>

<br />
<span class="style2">&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Email #1</strong><br /><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pseudonym chosen by "the Phoenix" immediately seeks to inspire admiration. We are dealing with someone very proud, very sure of himself. Care must be taken to manage the sensitivity that goes hand in hand with this kind of narcissism.<br />
<br />
2. His motivations. The technical performance and graphic skill with which the Phoenix designed his program might suggest that we are dealing with several individuals. The rare information sent by Lorski before his disappearance, however, suggests the opposite: he is a single man, who, aware of his "genius," seeks, through this "achievement," a form of recognition, a constant found among certain serial killers. By creating puzzles to deliver clues drop by drop, by constantly playing at hiding the information he agrees to reveal, the Phoenix asserts himself as manipulative and highly intelligent. No one can doubt his intelligence. He values it. His ability to imagine ingenious and complex devices should lead us to take some precautions: the individual appears calculating and therefore dangerous.<br />
<br />
3. The content of the riddles posed by the Phoenix proves that he knows several languages, including Latin, and that he is steeped in esoteric references. He undoubtedly comes from a wealthy social background. Looking to the past, he fuels his speculations with religious and historical knowledge. All this may seem confusing, but make no mistake: as with many serial killers, the Phoenix's actions follow a logic hidden beneath an irrational appearance. What Truth is the Phoenix seeking to reveal to us? It's probably by discovering him that we'll find our way back to him, as Jack Lorski and his friend must have done.<br />
<br />
4. Are Jack Lorski and Karen Gijman in great danger? Yes, if we consider that they are in the hands of someone who won't hesitate to kill; no, if we consider that the Phoenix has done everything to make us take a lasting interest in him; he himself doesn't feel clear about what drives him. One way or another, he needs you.
<br />

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;He carries a message. Unlike a criminal who seeks to cover up all traces and discreetly disappear, the Phoenix loudly expresses that it holds a message. Deciphering and interpreting this central mystery seems the only way to defuse its fury. We must, tactically at least, grant the Phoenix the "understanding" it seeks.<br />
<br />
2. The inscription "Sol invictus" discovered in Oxford should be compared with the contents of the ancient book (cult of Helios) and the planetary symbols to which the Phoenix draws our attention by using them on its CD-ROM: there is a consistency in its way of acting. Behind the repetitions and similarities lie connections and meanings. It is only by discovering these connections that we will be able to understand the motivation for his actions.<br />
<br />
3. The white chasuble, the evocation of the sun, the cruelty are elements that express strong unconscious concerns about guilt, punishment, and redemption. We are not dealing here with a serial killer suddenly acting on a sexual impulse. The Phoenix obeys recurring compulsions, long rehashed in morbid speculation. The murders are carried out according to a protocol that he applies, under the constraint of a meticulous internal obligation, as if copying a model (which one? "A star whose enemies have not triumphed"?). He is probably suffering from intrusive thoughts, a nightmare that constantly returns, the fantasy of a mission that alone could overcome a deep sense of guilt.<br />
<br />
4. He kills in cold blood. The mental universe he forces us to explore, laden with esotericism and mythology, seems devoid of concrete humanity. People are cruelly eliminated without obvious emotion and probably without remorse. Only ancient representations of symbols seem to fascinate him, which speak to him. With the blood of his victims, he writes.<br />
<br />
5. Who will win? The Phoenix has established a contract. This cThe contract involves blackmail through suffering, a threat looms, but everything is suspended, and during this time, it invites us to wander, following its instructions, into the twists and turns of its imagination. You take the active position. The Phoenix probably delights in the barriers you break down; the risk is enormous for it, but it has planned for it. If the Phoenix were to accept that it is suffering and undertake psychotherapy, it would be permissible to hope for its recovery, but it has probably never consulted a specialist.
<br />

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phoenix is particularly formidable because of its intelligence, and it seems driven by ideas that draw on an inexhaustible source of disturbing facts. While waiting to learn more about his peregrinations, the Phoenix appears to me to be a rootless individual, a European vagabond, deeply solitary. Sexually frustrated. Insensitivity, immorality, stubbornness, and instabilityâ€”I find here the classic core of a psychopathic personality.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing seems certain: the Phoenix hunts his future victims on the Internet. Many of them had websites. He will certainly persist and manifest himself under different pseudonyms. As observed with other criminals, the effectiveness of concealment reinforces the intoxication of impunity: defiance of the police and ideas of grandeur produce emphatic and provocative statements. Sometimes, this behavior is so reckless that it reflects an unconscious desire to be arrested.<br />
<br />
3. The accumulation of clues drawn from history, religion, and mythological representations fuels the dominant psychic process in his mental functioning: intellectualization. This mechanism allows him to repress the thought of the unspeakable impulses that are at work when he acts. Sensible existence is denied. Emotions and feelings are completely evacuated in favor of a highly structured cerebral elaboration. Everything that should make the hand tremble, the heart beat, in a word, doubt, has disappeared from the Phoenix's field of consciousness, blinded by ideals and chimeras.<br />
<br />
4. His sense of omnipotence, his megalomania, has swelled all the more since he has escaped prosecution. In any case, he doesn't feel guilty, but rather like a vigilante! The feeling of guilt is thus entirely rejected by his conscience, projected and attributed to others: his victims are guilty. There are elements in the Phoenix's attitude and words that are typically characteristic of paranoiacs, notably this conviction of conspiracy, persecution, and resentment: in this respect, the encounter with the Inquisition ideally and cerebrally represents the epitome of everything imaginable in terms of trap, torture, and cover-up.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without feeling paranoid, it's time to ask ourselves if all this can really be attributed to a single person. Since the beginning of this affair, I have been amazed by the Phoenix's capabilities. The dual skills, computer and artistic, developed in the creation of the CD already seemed a rare occurrence; if we add to this all the movements, actions, and knowledge, it seems reasonable to consider the existence of a second person. The Phoenix was perfectly capable of subjugating someone close to him, drawing them into his beliefs, dominating them, and thus benefiting from complementary skills and know-how.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypothesis of a sect practicing satanic cults, of which the Phoenix is the guru, must logically be considered. One could thus link the different events by assuming that the pseudonym is the spokesperson for a group of individuals acting in concert. At this stage, to tell the truth, the lone serial killer theory remains the most likely, even if his extraordinary abilities leave me perplexed.<br />
<br />

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Memoriam, the inscription found after the journalist's murder, gives us more than a signature: it expresses the motivation the Phoenix gives himself, the banner under which he is convinced he is acting. We knew he was immersed in the past; now we see that he is violently bringing this past back to the present. He is the obedient and loyal soldier of a Cid Campeador, whose embalmed remains ride at the head.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Giordano Bruno. What does this character represent? Giordano Bruno, who was considered the most erudite scholar of his time, the one who had read all the books published in his time, is the man who holds absolute knowledge. An inegallant, overwhelming, like a Father. But in the collective memory, Giordano Bruno also remains the man who was condemned, and burned, for the heretical ideas born of his prolific imagination: he thus represents at the same time the danger of guilty ideas, the punishment of bad thoughts. Ambivalent fantasies are condensed in this figure. Between an overwhelming Superego and forbidden impulses bursting into the Real, all guilt denied, without managing to organize its landmarks, the Phoenix, like the bird rising from its ashes, fled into the imaginary and the symbolic. He began to seek out everything that confusedly resonated within him, ignoring anything that could have brought him back to common reason. Convinced that he was accessing the Truth, he misunderstood himself. Madness is nothing more than "misfortune that is unaware of itself."<br />
<br />
3. Has the Phoenix become schizophrenic? We have already highlighted the Phoenix's taste for enigmas, the immoderate use of proper names, the systematic practice of codes and ancient languages, the fascination with myths and hermetic abstractions: we ultimately realize that the Phoenix has constructed a personal symphony, an emanation of an imaginary world. His thought is dominated by syncretism and symbolism. Emotions hidden beneath a pseudo-cynical indifference allow criminal impulses to emerge in bursts. Guided by the idea of revenge to be accomplished, by acting In Memoriam, the Phoenix seems to be experiencing depersonalization.<br />
<br />
4. Warning! The internal tensions of the Phoenix's psychic life have far exceeded the threshold most of us could tolerate. A brutal confrontation with an unforeseen event could break the last barriers that intermittently maintain its ability to communicate with you.<br />
<br />
<span class="style2">&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Email #5</strong><br /><br />
Jack and Karen are safe and sound. We are all happy with this conclusion, which I must admit I hadn't really anticipated.<br />
<br />
I was able to interview them a few hours after their release. They are clearly suffering, and this long captivity will leave its mark. But they will recover with time. They gave me some information that must remain confidential for the purposes of the investigation, but which, overall, reinforces my convictions about the Phoenix's modus operandi.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the Phoenix's madness, while pursuing an irrational and insane goal, responded to a logic: since Jack and Karen were not members of Manus Domini, the Phoenix had no reason to kill them. He remained faithful to his logic to the end. Perhaps in his eyes, Karen, also a victim of Manus Domini's criminal actions, was even a bit like a sister.<br />
<br />
He therefore used them to share with us his conviction that there was a terrible conspiracy against the truth. A top-down manipulation against the dissemination of revelations that would shake certain institutions, particularly religious ones.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, the police will publish a composite sketch of the killer, but it's a safe bet that this champion of metamorphoses has already changed appearance as we speak.<br /><br /><br /></li>
