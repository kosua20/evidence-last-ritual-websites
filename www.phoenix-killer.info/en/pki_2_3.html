      <p>The <strong>ICPA</strong> is a private association 
    created by friends and colleagues of journalist Jack Lorski in the wake of his murder in 
    Scotland. The ICPA is aimed at helping international police and law departments

<h2>MESSAGES FROM THE PHOENIX</h2>
<p><strong>The Phoenix needs to see his power recognized, even going so far as to taunt the police by providing them with clues (the CD-ROMs), as if drawing additional strength from the devices put in place to capture him. This thirst for recognition also translates into his need to communicate with those hunting him and explain his actions, or even justify them.
To help you better understand the personality of this killer, we have selected his main messages below.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="style1">Email sent after the release of Jack Lorski and Karen Gijman</span><br />
<br />
Everything was planned from the start. Everything.<br />
Except Jack's stubbornness.<br />
His obstinacy in following in my footsteps exasperated me at first.<br />
But very quickly I understood that he and his girlfriend could serve the realization of the Work, at least contribute to making it known.<br />
Because these two weren't the Chosen Ones.<br /><br />

Everything was planned. Everything.<br />
I knew that one day or another someone would manage to decipher the work.<br />
If it hadn't been you, it would have been someone else.<br />
I knew that one day or another, they would come to free them.<br />
They came but didn't find me.<br />
By the time they arrived to free them, I was already far away. Very far away.<br />
They won't find me. Never.<br />
His Work accomplished, the Phoenix flew towards the sun.<br /><br />
The black Sun, invincible.<br />
<br /><br /></li>

<br />
I was sure you would reach this point, little friend<br />
By opening the doors of my Work one by one<br />
You ended up thinking like me<br />
You ended up becoming a Chosen One<br />
You now know part of the Truth<br />
Opening this testament and reading it<br />
Could only be child play for you<br /><br />
Before disappearing forever, I wanted to leave you this testament<br />
February 17, 2003 Guido Forlino, known as Guido Corliano, was my last victim.<br />
He was leading Manus Domini, and he paid like the others.<br />
He paid for his predecessors.<br />
Those who ordered Volker's execution.<br />
In homage to my master, I left his corpse on the Campo Dei Fiori.<br /><br />
But before dying, Guido gave me vital information.<br />
I now know where the cursed book is kept.<br />
I now know who owns the work.<br />
And who protects Manus Domini.<br />
And my revenge has only just begun.<br /><br />
Gerd Hanke and the others are now on my trail.<br />
They have information that could help find me.<br />
Carefulness dictates that I should hide for a few months.<br />
In hommage to my master, I chose to disappear.<br />
On the 17th February...<br /><br />
No doubt my absence will create a void<br />
Even monsters have their idols<br />
Taking with me the secrets that can only be revealed to a select few<br />
I'm flying away definitively to the invincible Black Sun<br />
<br /><br /></li>
<li><span class="style1">Last message written on his white CD-ROM</span><br />
<br />
Ha ha ha, that Alex was so naive!<br />
He thought he could destroy Manus Domini single-handedly! What pride!<br />
In any case, his report risked compromising my plans;<br />
Despite all the hatred I feel for this organization<br />
I would rather chose to silence him...<br />
<br />
He didn't suffer... or very little.<br />
To accomplish the Ultimate Work, his death was necessary.<br />
Before dying, Guido Corliano, the leader of Manus Domini,<br />
Gave me the information that will allow me to find<br />
The Book<br />
<br />
I didn't want the police to thwart my plan by delving<br />
into the arcana of the organization and its past.<br />
From now on, nothing will be able to stop the Resurrection of the Phoenix.<br /><br />
The Angels of Prague remember and mourn<br />
But the Phoenix, guided by its Supreme Mission, does not hear them;<br />
He hovers above the world of men,<br />
Above the sphere of the Angels,<br />
Very high in the Light of the Black Sun,<br />
Where it is impossible to distinguish Good from Bad.<br />
<br />
The Ultimate Work will be accomplished...
<br />
<br /><br /></li>
<li><span class="style1">Email sent after decrypting the blank CD-ROM</span><br />
<br />
You now know the Truth, little friend<br />
If Jesus summoned certain Demons at the moment of death<br />
It's because he was Initiated<br />
Into these secret rites that for centuries they have tried to hide from us<br />
<br />
Giordano had discovered it in his time<br />
They killed him for it<br />
The Phoenix avenged him<br />
<br />
But the Book exists<br />
All those who have tried to seize it<br />Have died tragically<br />
Murdered by Manus Domini<br />
Or sacrificed like Carolina on the altar of the Black Sun<br />
By me.<br /><br />
This Quest cannot be shared<br />
<br />
It will be completed<br />
The day I will finally have the Book in my hands<br />
For I am the only one capable of grasping all its secrets.<br />
<br /><br /></li>
<li><span class="style1">Message written on his website on February 17, 2005</span><br />
<br />
You have now reached the threshold of your initiation, little friend<br />
You now know Luna's identity<br /><br />
I had maintained a long correspondence with her via the Internet<br />
This little girl was very naive to agree to this meeting<br />
Attracted by the Mystery and my power of seduction<br />
Her curiosity didn't last long...<br />
<br />
The full moon shone over the lagoon that evening.<br />
I had taken care to neutralize this brave Jack and his pretty partner.<br />
I laid her tortured body in front of the Traitor's Palace.<br /><br />
I now walk towards the Light<br />
No one, not even Gerd Hanke, will be able to stop me<br />
The Cursed Book will reveal its secrets to me<br />
The Resurrection is underway<br />
<br />
See you soon, little friend<br />
