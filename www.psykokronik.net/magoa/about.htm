  <p><strong><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">::ABOUT:: 
    </font></strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    purpose of MAGOA is quite simple: to reunite in a single website all the best 
    artists in the graphic and collages field. I first started doing collages 
    when I was a big fan of The X-Files, but since the 6th season I've stopped 
    watching it and also stopped doing fanart oriented collages. Its a reason 
    why even if your art isn't related to a tv show you are still accepted, because 
    diversity is always best.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
    do <u>not</u> make any money out of this organisation, just as all the other 
    members of MAGOA. All images are belonging to their respective owners. Please 
    do not steal anything from the artists listed here.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>FAQ</strong></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">01.<b> 
    Is Magoa a directory/Fan Listing or something?</b><br>
    Magoa is none of the above, this site leans more to listing potential great 
    web artists who are talented, and take graphic design with a passion. In a 
    way it kind of look like a listing of some sort, but it's a circle of excellent 
    artist who produces creative arts.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">02.<b> 
    How do I join Magoa and what does it take?</b><br>
    By <a href="join.htm">applying using the join form</a>.&nbsp;It takes lots 
    of creativity, at least some good artworks and a little of your time.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">03.<b> 
    What do I do once my site's approved?</b><br>
    I can only say &quot;congratulations&quot; you're accepted into Magoa, all 
    you need to do now is to place a text link <b> or</b> button up on your site, 
    on anywhere <b>visible</b>. If you don't, then no matter how &quot;out of 
    this world&quot; your art is, I will not list you down.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">04.<b> 
    I've been rejected :( what now?</b><br>
    Don't feel dejected, it does not mean the end of the world. You are <b>allowed</b> 
    to re-apply again. Once you're brimming with confidence, go ahead the join 
    form is always open.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">05. 
    <b>Is Magoa Elite?</b><br>
    Magoa only list the <b>best</b> fanart site on the net(at least the ones that 
    have been submitted), it is <b>no way</b> elite in any shape or form. Anyone 
    is free to join, just bear in mind, there will always be a chance that your 
    site might get rejected, if your arts is not up to our standard or expectation.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    FAQ was originaly created by Milo and slightly changed by myself.</font></p>
