                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In January 1692, in Salem, the pastor’s daughter 
                            Elizabeth Parris and her cousin, Abigail Williams, began to exhibit behavioral problems 
                            of concern to those around them. Nine-year old Elizabeth would burst into tears inexplicably 
                            and throw screaming fits at the top of her lungs, while 11-year old Abigail began crawling 
                            on all fours yapping like a dog. Soon, six other girls, including Ann Putman Jr., the 
                            daughter of the Sergeant, also started performing strange contortions, shrieking and foaming 
                            at the mouth. Subsequently other, more serious symptoms began to appear: tremors, 
                            convulsions, shortness of breath and hallucinations.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><img src="images/docteur.jpg" width="352" height="220" border="1" alt="Dr. Griggs examines the girls"></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In February, doctors called to the girls’ bedsides were 
                            unable to identify the cause of their illness. As impotent as his colleagues, Salem’s doctor 
                            William Griggs went so far as to declare that the only explanation for the girls’ behavior was 
                            that they were under the influence of Satan. From that point on, every time someone fell ill or 
                            began acting abnormally, people would seek out the &quot;warlock&quot; or &quot;witch&quot; responsible for that 
                            person’s condition.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><img src="images/Salem-Village_s-First-Meeti.jpg" width="250" height="164" border="1" alt="Salem Meeting House"></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In March, under the pressure of villagers eager to know 
                            what was tormenting them, Elizabeth and Abigail denounced Samuel Parris’s servant Tituba, 
                            along with two elderly widows already despised by the community, Sarah Osborne and Sarah Good. 
                            The three women were immediately accused of witchcraft and thrown in jail.<br>
                            Magistrates John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin were responsible for interrogating the suspects 
                            at the village meeting house. The two elderly women fervently denied the accusations, while Tituba, 
                            a West Indian slave and adherent of Voodoo, made this shocking declaration: &quot;The Devil came to me 
                            and bid me serve him for six years&quot;. Despite the terror this confession provoked amongst members 
                            of the assembly, she went on to specify how a white-haired man, dressed in black, appeared to her 
                            and told her he was God. After recounting how the man asked her both to believe him and serve him 
                            for six years, Tituba then described how he presented her a book in which she left a mark with her 
                            own blood. Finally, Tituba maintained that a number of marks already figured in this book, including 
                            those of her two co-defendants and several other residents of Salem and neighboring villages.<br>
                            The whole town was struck with fear and began to pray, but the young girls’ fits continued all 
                            the more. Twelve-year old Ann Putnam Jr. in turn accused Martha Corey and Rebecca Nurse of having 
                            made a pact with the devil. Despite the two women’s good reputation, local Chief Justice William 
                            Stoughton managed to convince the jury to jail them.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><img src="images/giles_corey.jpg" width="150" height="265" border="1" alt="Martha and Giles Corey"></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">From April to September, people’s fear turned into mass 
                            hysteria. Villagers started having visions; some imagined ghosts whirling around them, while others 
                            pictured creatures creeping into their bedrooms. Everyone began to suspect everyone else; 
                            accusations began to fly. The incriminations multiplied, and the jails started to fill at an alarming 
                            rate. In a matter of a few weeks, over 70 people had been thrown behind bars for basically hare-brained 
                            or self-interested reasons: one person had a baby out of wedlock, while another had a wart on his back; 
                            one person was accused of telling futures, while another was denounced for drinking unknown beverages; 
                            one person had failed to pay debts, while another merely suffered from a bad reputation, etc. </p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In June, faced with overflowing jails, a special tribunal 
                            called the Court of Oyer and Terminer, or &quot;Witch Court,&quot; met in Salem to judge all those suspected 
                            of witchcraft. Throughout this mass trial, the majority of the accused claimed their innocence, 
                            but several women, out of fear of torture or somehow hoping to save themselves in this way, 
                            confessed to acting in concert with the Devil. Death sentences were handed down and the first 
                            victim, Bridget Bishop, was hanged on June 10.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><img src="images/hanging_bbishop.jpg" width="335" height="291" border="1" alt="Hanging of Bridget Bishop"></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">On July 19, Sarah Good, Rebecca Nurse and three other &quot;witches&quot; 
                            were executed. On August 19, another group of five of the accused, which included Salem’s former 
                            reverend George Burroughs, was hanged straight away. On September 22, a group of nine of the condemned, 
                            which included Martha Corey, was led to the gallows.<br>To these 20 or so executions must be added 
                            those who died in prison through torture, such as Sarah Osborne, or those who perished due to the 
                            unsanitary condition of the jails. Finally, Giles Corey, a rich, 80-year old farmer whose ghost 
                            supposedly haunted the dreams of Ann Putman Jr.’s mother, steadfastly refused to be judged. 
                            His terrible punishment was immediately carried out: he was stretched out upon the ground, his body 
                            covered with heavier upon heavier stones until he was smothered and crushed to death. Before succumbing, 
                            he declared: &quot;But if a word could save me, and that word were not the Truth; 
                            nay, if it did but swerve a hair's-breadth from the Truth, I would not say it.&quot;</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><img src="images/SalemWitchcraft.jpg" width="450" height="307" border="1" alt="Trial scene"></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In October, a number of Salem’s residents began to doubt the 
                            veracity of the eight girls’ accusations. Some of them had even denounced their own parents, 
                            as well as the judges supposedly protected by God himself.<br>Alerted by a letter from Thomas Brattle 
                            denouncing the absurdity of the witch hunt, and frightened by the increasing number of accusations 
                            (his own wife had started to worry), Governor William Phips rejected the use of ghostly visions as 
                            evidence. He ordered that henceforth no accusation or trial could be based upon the testimony of 
                            spectral apparition without tangible proof. He dissolved the Court of Oyer and Terminer and replaced 
                            it with The Superior Court of Judiciature.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><img src="images/phiportrait.png" width="213" height="250" border="0" alt="Governor William Phips"></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In November, the new court set free all those waiting to be 
                            judged and pardoned those already condemned; Tituba, the first of the accused, benefited from this 
                            clemency: she was cleared after retracting her previous statements.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In December, jurors admitted publicly to having condemned and 
                            put innocent people to death, and begged forgiveness of the victims’ families. Thus ended the tragedy 
                            of the Salem witch trials, which sent more than 200 innocent people to prison and another 30 or so to 
                            their deaths.<br>One of the accusing girls admitted at the time: &quot;We did it to entertain ourselves 
                            and had a good time.&quot;.<br>&nbsp;</p>
