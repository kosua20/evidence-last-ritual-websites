                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In the late 17<sup>th</sup> century, Salem was divided into two distinct parts: 
                            the city of Salem, a noble and prosperous economic center, and Salem Village (or <i>Salem Farms</i>) consisting 
                            of a very puritanical farming community.<br><br>
                            The large and influential Putnam family owned the biggest area of farmland in Salem Village. 
                            Its members strongly desired the separation of Salem’s two sections, as they believed that the city’s 
                            residents were straying further and further away from the precepts of the Bible. They therefore encouraged 
                            Salem’s villagers to found their own church.<br>
                            The first pastor to this new church, Reverend George Burroughs, held office for only two years. 
                            In fact, a shady story of unpaid debts put him on bad terms with Sergeant Thomas Putnam, the powerful 
                            head of the Putnam family, thereby forcing him to leave his ministry.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><IMG height=179 alt="Samuel Parris" src="images/1a.png" width=146 border=0 ></p>		    
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In 1689, the Putnam family called upon Samuel Parris, the head 
                            of the Parris family, and offered him the post of Salem Village’s new minister. From that point on, 
                            the two families held very close ties.<br>In 1691, despite this friendship, a village committee 
                            voted against levying a tax guaranteeing steady income to Samuel Parris. Embittered, the minister 
                            avenged this refusal by proclaiming in his sermons that a conspiracy against the church had been 
                            hatched within the village. He even went so far as to assert that the Devil had taken possession 
                            of certain villagers—this a year before the eight girls’ accusations!</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><IMG height=378 alt="Thomas Putman’s statement against George Burroughs" src  ="images/H12A.png" width=458 border=0 ></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">In 1692, at the height of the mass hysteria, it was reported 
                            that the Putnam and Parris families wielded enormous influence over the witch trials’ developments.<br>
                            On the one hand, five of the eight "afflicted" girls were affiliated with the two families 
                            (Elizabeth Parris and Abigail Williams were, respectively, daughter and niece to Samuel Parris, 
                            while Ann Putnam Jr., Mary Walcott and Mercy Lewis were daughter, niece and servant to Thomas Putnam). 
                            These five were, moreover, the most fervent of the eight accusers.<br>
                            On the other hand, the majority of those accused were either enemies of or maintained antagonistic 
                            relationships with the two clans (for example: Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, Rebecca Nurse, George Burroughs, and Giles and Martha Corey).</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><IMG height=373 alt="Arrest of Reverend George Burroughs" src  ="images/burroughs2.jpg" width=500 border=1 ></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">Without accusing the Parris and Putnam families of having 
                            premeditated the hysterical escalation of incriminations, it is clear that the two families 
                            largely benefited from fanning the flames, thereby settling old scores with their rivals.<br>
                            Beginning in October 1692, moreover, Samuel Parris became the focus of the hostility of villagers 
                            who had fallen victim to his machinations, and despite the timid excuses he made in 1694, 
                            he was forced to leave Salem for good in 1697.<br>&nbsp;</p>

                            them, the question remains how eight girls from Puritan families were able to exhibit such insane 
                            behavior simultaneously. It should be recalled that none of the many doctors consulted at the 
                            time managed to make a diagnosis.</p>

                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">Nearly 300 years after the fact, New York-based behavioral 
                            psychologist Linda Caporael has drawn attention to similarities between the Salem girls’ symptoms 
                            and those exhibited by people sick from ingesting ergot, the spores of a parasite that infects 
                            rye grain.<br>Scientific studies of this fungus show that ergot is a polycyclic alkaloid naturally 
                            derived from lysergic acid, or none other than LSD. It directly effects the nervous system, 
                            provoking violent muscular contractions, hallucinations and the feeling of insects crawling under 
                            the skin.<br>Furthermore, ergot thrives in the spring or summer during hot, humid and rainy 
                            weather; the diary of one Salem resident reveals how these were the exact climactic conditions 
                            prevailing in 1692. When one considers that Tituba, the Parris family servant, was in the habit 
                            of gathering the eight Salem girls around her and feeding them a "<i>witchcake</i>" made from rye, 
                            one can reasonably assume that the girls had simply become intoxicated by this hallucinogenic 
                            fungus, and were in no way "bewitched."<br>&nbsp;</p>

                            first signs of trouble, Tituba would spend hours telling them stories about her native country. 
                            Sometimes, secretly, the servant would perform voodoo magic tricks for them or tell their futures. 
                            The girls enjoyed this so much that they were unable to keep quiet about it for very long; they 
                            soon shared their secret with their friends. This is how the black slave managed to assemble the 
                            eight future "possessed" girls around her several times a week.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="center"><IMG height=316 alt="Tituba and the girls" src  ="images/titubaswmus1.jpg" width=500 border=1 ></p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">One day, when Abby was peacefully enjoying a drink, she saw a 
                            ghost appear in the form of a coffin floating in her glass. No doubt the initial hallucinatory 
                            effects of the rye ergot were the cause, fueled by Tituba’s fantastic stories. The two cousins 
                            believed, however, that they were sinking into damnation.</p>
                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">Like everyone else at the time, the two girls considered 
                            telling the future as witchcraft, and therefore a very grave sin. In fact, divination was associated 
                            with the betrayal of God and pacts with the devil. Believing themselves damned for having listened 
                            to Tituba and egged on by those around them, they eventually accused the slave of witchcraft.</p>

                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">For a long time witchcraft had been viewed as a set of 
                            personal beliefs and superstitions with no harmful repercussions. Beginning in the 17<sup>th</sup> 
                            century, however, it became considered an "anti-religion" and a "criminal act" against society. 
                            From that point on, all those who did not conform to social norms were subject to accusations 
                            of witchcraft.</p>

                            <p class="namo-list" align="justify">Possessing little or no education, the poor tended to have a 
                            primitive, naïve and easily influenced state of mind. The majority of them poverty-stricken, the 
                            villagers of Salem were deeply impressed by the eight girls’ inexplicable behavior. Thoroughly 
                            terrified by Tituba’s statements during her cross-examination, most villagers believed "in good faith" 
                            that they had been stricken with a diabolical curse. This terror easily explains the mass hysteria 
                            which led them to suspect anyone who looked physically different or behaved abnormally of
engaging in witchcraft</span>.</p>

                            the scars of the past. For more than three centuries, historians, sociologists, psychologists
