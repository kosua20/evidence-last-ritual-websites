			On the night of December 20, 2005, <font color="#2C317B"><b>Gilbert Masson</b></font>, Managing Director of <b>The Saint Dominic Foundation</b>, and <font color="#2C317B"><b>Marylin Evans</b></font>, his primary associate, were savagely murdered in our New York premises while working together on the President’s speech to have been delivered at the 2005 Christmas tree-lighting ceremony.
			<br>
			Upon the announcement of this hateful double-murder, every team in the Organization experienced the same feelings of disgust, distress and deep injustice, so well were these two individuals known and respected by all for their devotion to our cause.
			<br>
			With these humble words, we intend to pay homage to these two great servants of <b>The Saint Dominic Foundation</b>. We also wish to declare our profound sympathy and full support of their families, so cruelly stricken by this painful event. We give prayer that God grant Gilbert and Marylin the eternal rest they deserved.
			<br>
			We will see each other again, in that place where there is no darkness.
			<br>

			<font color="#2C317B"><b>Gilbert Masson (1951-2005)</b></font>
			<br>
			Native to Southeastern France, Gilbert Masson moved to New York in 1978 after completing brilliant studies in philosophy and theology at Catholic University of Lyon. That same year, he incorporated <b>The Saint Dominic Foundation</b> and received its mission before the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In this respect, he was most notably involved in the establishment of fundraising protocols still in effect today.
			<br>
			In 1984, he was named Director of the Communications and Research Department. In this strategic position, he helped bring about a sharp increase in <b>The Saint Dominic Foundation</b>’s visibility both in the United States and abroad.
			<br>
			In 1986, he conceived and launched the organization’s first Fall Action Campaign, which met with such resounding success that it has been repeated every year since.
			<br>
			In 1989, he was named Deputy Managing Director of <b>The Saint Dominic Foundation</b>. He worked seven years in close collaboration with President Philip Whiteman. Together the two established development programs in Asia and Africa.
			<br>
			In 1996, after the death of Philip Whiteman, the National Council unanimously named him Managing Director. For nine years he worked tirelessly on expanding the organization and increasing its operations throughout the world. He is especially well remembered for the financial aid he granted to families of the victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, as well as his efficient response after the terrible tsunami of December 26, 2004 which ravaged Southeast Asia.
			<br>
			We retain the image of this devoted servant as a straight and honest man of extreme moral and spiritual rigor who, through his work, steadfastness and God’s help, succeeded in leading <b>The Saint Dominic Foundation</b> to the prominence it holds today. May he forever be thanked.
