  <h3>Information</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> an exceptional programme, in that it provides a summary of nearly 1&nbsp;000 years 
  of Portuguese history and identity, ranging from Porto to Lisbon, whose largely unknown legacy 
  to European culture is priceless, such as the blossoming of Manueline and baroque arts, 
  the introduction of overseas' riches into the West (gold, ivory, precious wood, silk, spices, tea and coffee)
  and the spreading of Portuguese traditions in Asia, Africa and the Americas, 
  that continue to thrive today, such as the language, Catholicism and music!</p>
  <p><strong>Tour programme:</strong> the visits and excursions mentioned in the programme may be 
  changed or the order reversed, according to local constraints (such as weather conditions, 
  road traffic, peak periods at the sites visited, and so on) and the return flights on the 
  first and last days; in addition, visits to certain monuments are sometimes restricted to the outside surroundings, when 
  tourists are temporarily denied access due to high visitor levels, renovation work or local events (such as 
  village fairs and church masses).</p>
  <p><strong>Hotel rating:</strong> the hotels selected during the tour have been awarded a 3 or 4-star rating in accordance 
  with local standards.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> the prices advertised are based on a minimum of 12 people taking part in the tour; 
  however, the tour is guaranteed for a minimum of four passengers registered by the deadline, subject 
  to an extra charge of 563 euros per person - this charge may be reduced to 144 euros per person if the number 
  of people registered by the deadline is between 8 and 11; the final price will be confirmed 
  30 days prior to the date of departure.</p>
  <p><strong>Air transport</strong> (information subject to change by the tour operator): flights are operated 
  by Portugal's scheduled airlines - Air Luxor and TAP Air Portugal.</p>
  <h3>Programme</h3>
  <p>Take full advantage of a prestigious and extensive tour, taking you from town to town between Porto and Lisbon, 
  following an itinerary lined with major sites steeped in art and history, which are often listed as 
  Unesco World Heritage Sites, in the heart of the Portuguese national identity: Porto, Guimaraes, Braga, Coimbra, Batalha, Alcobaça, Obidos, Fatima, Tomar, Evora, Sintra 
  and Lisbon.</p>
	  <h4>DAY 1: PARIS/PORTO/POVOA DE VARZIM</h4>
	  <p>After meeting up at Paris airport and checking in your luggage, the flight will leave for Porto. Upon arrival 
	  in Porto, you will be welcomed by your 
	  English-speaking guide and taken to your hotel in Povoa de Varzim, 20 km inland from Porto. 
	  You will be shown to your rooms, following which dinner will be served. You will spend the night at the hotel.</p>
	  <h4>DAY 2: POVOA/GUIMARAES/BRAGA/BARCELOS/POVOA (approx. 150 km)</h4>
	  <p>Breakfast at the hotel. Visit to the city of Guimaraes, after travelling up through Minho valley. 
	  Guimaraes, Portugal's first capital, is where the powerful dynasty of the Dukes of Bragança tightened 
	  its grip on the kingdom's throne, which had been released from Spanish control in 1640: 
	  you will stroll through the old part of town before entering the Ducal Palace in Vila Viçosa, 
	  which has been wonderfully restored and resplendent with elaborately carved furniture, and which lies 
	  on foundations built in the 15th century. The journey then continues to Braga, another 
	  testament to Portuguese identity: Braga is undoubtedly the city that best demonstrates 
	  Portugal's deep attachment to the Catholic faith, such is the sacred art of the countless 
	  churches and chapels in the old part of the city glorified with splendour and passion, owing it the 
	  nickname of the "Rome of Portugal"! After visiting the beautiful cathedral, you will discover the 
	  famous monastery of Bom Jesus do Monte with its remarkable baroque architecture. Lunch will be 
	  provided during the day. Return to Povoa de Varzim. The evening includes dinner with a show 
	  at the Povoa casino. Night at the hotel.
</p>
<h4>DAY 3: POVOA/PORTO/COIMBRA/FIGUEIRA DA FOZ (approx. 150 km)</h4>
<p>Breakfast at the hotel. Visit to the city of Porto. Portugal's second-largest city on account of the number of inhabitants, 
its modern industries and its working port focused on Atlantic trade, Porto is also home to an historical centre 
of immense architectural wealth, where you will visit the stock exchange building erected in 1834, and then the 
baroque church of Sao Francisco with its delicate woodcarvings gilded with fine gold. Porto is also renowned 
for the quality of its wines of the same name, whose vineyards are cultivated on the terraces of Douro valley: 
follow the wine-ageing rooms in a cellar in Vila Nova de Gaia and sample a glass of authentic Porto wine! Then the journey moves
on to Coimbra. Stop-off in the village of Ribeira for lunch. Arrival in Coimbra: the old medieval town is well 
worth visiting, with its maze of narrow alleyways around the "Sé Velha", a Romanesque-style cathedral, 
before admiring the university founded in 1290, whose fame spread during the reign of John III, 
who joined it to the royal palace in 1537 and adorned it with luxurious rooms, such as the "Sala dos Capelos", 
and a richly-stocked library - a wonderful example of baroque art. The trip carries on to Figueira da Voz, a 
seaside resort. Dinner and night at the hotel in Figueira.</p>
<h4>DAY 4: FIGUEIRA/BATALHA/NAZARE/ALCOBACA/OBIDOS/FIGUEIRA (approx. 150 km)</h4>
<p>Breakfast at the hotel. Visit to the town of Batalha: this is home to the monastery of Santa Maria da Victoria, 
a hotspot in Portugal's collective memory, commemorating the rout of Castile's armies at the battle of 
Aljubarrota in 1385, with its elegant stone filigrees providing a wonderful example of the Portuguese 
Manueline style. The journey continues to Nazaré, a charming fishing village, which makes an ideal place to stop for 
some lunch. Onwards to Alcobaça: visit to the monastery of Santa Maria founded in 1153 by the first king 
of Portugal, Alfonso Henriques of Burgundy, a masterpiece of Cistercian art and home to the tombs 
of King Dom Pedro and Queen Ines, the literary heroes in Montherlant's novel "La reine morte" (The Dead Queen)! 
The journey moves on to Obidos: this small medieval town features paved squares and flower-adorned 
roads, lying in the shadow cast by the high ramparts and massive towers. Return to Figueiras da Foz at the 
end of the day. Dinner and night at the hotel in Figueira.</p>
<h4>DAY 5: FIGUEIRA/FATIMA/TOMAR/EVORA (approx. 295 km)</h4>  	
  <p>Breakfast at the hotel. Visit to the Catholic sanctuary of Fatima: if the legend is anything to go by, 
  an angel and then the Blessed Virgin, radiant with light, appeared before the 
  local shepherds and farmers on several occasions in 1916 and 1917; today, Fatima is a Mecca 
  for pilgrims from all over Europe. Onwards to Tomar, home of the Convent of Christ, 
  listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site. The convent was the headquarters of the mighty 
  Order of the Knights Templar in the 12th century and was embellished in the purest 
  Manueline style by King Henry the Navigator in the 15th century. Lunch in Tomar. Back on the road to 
  Evora, crossing through the plains of Alentejo. Arrival in Evora by early evening. Dinner and night at the hotel.</p>
  <h4>DAY 6: EVORA/COSTA ARRABIDA/LISBON (approx. 170 km)</h4>
  <p>Breakfast at the hotel. Visit to the town of Evora: the old part of town is also listed as a 
  Unesco World Heritage Site and is home to buildings dating back to antiquity, 
  with the Temple of Diana featuring among Portugal's best preserved Roman remains, to the Middle Ages, 
  with the 13th century cathedral built out of granite and tapered with a high tower, and especially 
  to the 15th century, such as the stately residences lining the Rua Romao Ramalho and Rua Sao Man&ccedil;os, 
  the church of Sao Joao Evangelista, the university adorned with magnificent azulejos, or even the 
  Pa&ccedil;o dos Duques de Cadaval, a former royal residence. Lunch in Evora. 
  The tour sets off for Lisbon, passing through the Costa d'Arrabida nature reserve, a protected 
  coastal and marine area. Arrival in Lisbon by travelling over the 13&nbsp;km Vasco de Gama bridge, straddling the 
  river Tagus and providing a panoramic view of the city. Dinner and night at the hotel.</p>
  <h4>DAY 7: LISBON/SINTRA/CASCAIS/CABO DA ROCA/LISBON (approx. 100 km)</h4>
  <p>Breakfast at the hotel. The morning will start with a tour of the city, which is ideal for discovering the 
  various districts of Lisbon, such as the popular and lively Alfama below Barrio Alto, Lisbon's original site 
  during the Middle Ages dominated by the old Sao Jorge Castle; Baixa, derived from the city's new layout 
  by the Marquis of Pombal in the wake of the destructive earthquake of 1755; Belem, with its Manueline-style 
  tower looming over the seafront, and the famous Hieronymites' monastery (called the Jeronimos Monastery) 
  founded in 1502 by King Manuel the Fortunate. A quick stop-off at the Monument of the Discoveries 
  dedicated to the famous Portuguese navigators of the Golden Century and inaugurated in 1960 to 
  coincide with the 500th anniversary of Henry the Navigator's death. Then lunch in the Belem district 
  to taste some authentic pasteis, Lisbon's very own pastry speciality! The morning will be rounded off 
  with a visit to the National Coach Museum. Lunch in Lisbon. Then you will hit the road for 
  a visit to Sintra: surrounded by the inland mountains, Sintra used to be the holiday getaway for Lisbon's aristocracy, giving 
  rise to the quintas, palaces, squares and streets that earned its place as a Unesco World Heritage 
  Site. After visiting the National Palace, where the royal family used to stay, 
  you will amble around the old part of town, admiring the stately homes dotted about in the San Pedro district, 
  or even the baroque-style Mafra monastery. Return to Lisbon by following the Atlantic coastline: 
  stop-off at Cabo da Roca, the rocky westernmost tip of mainland Europe. 
  The journey will continue via Cascais and Estoril. Arrival in Lisbon. Dinner and night 
  at the hotel.</p>
  <h4>DAY 8: LISBON/PARIS</h4>
  <p>Breakfast at the hotel. Check-out. Depending on the return flight times, transfer to Faro airport. 
  Luggage check-in. Flight for Paris.</p>
