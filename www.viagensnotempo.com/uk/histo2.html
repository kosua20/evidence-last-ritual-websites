      <h3>Vasco da Gama</h3>
      <p>In command of three heavily-armed ships, Vasco da Gama took to the sea on 8 July 1497. 
	  He sailed around the African coast, calling in at several ports on the way and always 
	  greeted with the utmost courtesy, probably due to the threatening sight of the ship's cannons. 
	  After arriving at the Hindu port of Calicut, where more than 1 500 ships were already anchored, 
	  Gama went to see the sovereign, the <em>Zamorin</em>. He found him lying down, 
	  chewing betel leaves and spitting them out into a gold bowl. 
	  The King of Portugal's letter delivered by Gama had hardly any effect on the sovereign. 
	  During his second visit, the welcome that Gama received was even worse. 
	  They laughed at his jodhpurs and his <em>ruff</em>. They asked him for gold: he did not have any. 
	  The <em>Zamorin</em> bellowed: "The merchants from Mecca show greater generosity than you!". 
	  A few years later in 1502, Gama returned to Calicut. To avenge his compatriots, who had been 
	  slaughtered at the hands of the Indians, he bombarded the city and 
	  destroyed the pursuing fleet.</p>

      <h3>The Aviz Dynasty and the Domination of the Seas</h3>
      <p>Upon his death, Ferdinand left only one daughter, Beatrice, who was engaged 
	  to John I of Castile, an ally of France, which opened the floodgates for a major crisis of 
	  succession (1383-1385), which pitted the nobility (in favour of a Castilian pretender to the crown) against the bourgeoisie (intent on 
	  maintaining Portuguese independence under the authority of a national prince). 
	  With backing from the English, the national candidate, John, a Grand Master of the Order of 
	  Aviz and illegitimate son of Pedro I and half-brother of Ferdinand, was brought to power, 
	  and the Cortes of Coimbra ratified the decision (1385). John I (1385-1433) and his 
	  general, Nuno Alvares Pereira, consolidated Portugal's independence by 
	  defeating the Castilians in Aljubarrota with the help of English mercenaries (1385); 
	  Portuguese independence was confirmed by the peace treaty of 1411 with Castile 
	  and the English alliance, which had been bolstered in 1387 by the marriage of John I and 
	  Philippa of Lancaster. The crisis enabled the new king to reduce the nobility's pretensions 
	  by relying on the support of the bourgeoisie, who had started to play a dominating 
	  role in the Cortes.</p>
      <p>Portuguese expansion continued in the 15th century. Intrepid journeys were made easier with the 
	  advent of scientific research (the astronomical tables of Alfonso X the Wise and the Iberian Jews) 
	  and the advances in shipbuilding (sternpost rudder, caravel developed in 1439-1440). There were many reasons 
	  for undertaking such journeys: Portugal's relative overpopulation, the no-go situation for 
	  pursuing a policy for continental expansion at the expense of the mighty Castile, the wheat 
	  shortage, the increased demand for fish, leather and dyestuffs, the search for new land suitable 
	  for sugar cane plantations, the need for slaves to operate the sugar mills that started cropping up in the 
	  Algarve, and the lack of gold that affected trade in the West. Ruined by the economic crisis, the knights
	  conquered the Moroccan port of Ceuta (1415); the bourgeois organised the colonisation 
	  of the Madeira Islands (from 1418) and the Azores (from 1432), and the exploration of the 
	  African coast to reach the country of gold; the Portuguese rounded Cape Bojador (1434) and reached 
	  Rio de Oro (1436). Taking advantage of King Edward's weakness (1433-1438), the nobility decided to go to war 
	  with Morocco. The failure at Tangiers (1437) and the minority of King Alfonso the African (1438-1481)
	  propelled the infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra, to the forefront, whom the Cortes appointed regent 
	  over his sister-in-law, Queen Eleanor of Aragon (1440); "Alfonsine legislation" attempted to 
	  codify and standardise Portuguese law. Pacific expansion continued to develop, though heavy on the
	  bourgeois' pockets: wheat fields and then sugar cane covered Madeira and the Azores; 
	  explorers passed the Saharan coast and reached the black people's country, where they 
	  forged more convenient trade relations: Portugal's first gold coin, the cruzado, was minted in 1457. 
	  But the young king Alfonso V, goaded by the great lords, provoked Pedro to revolt, who 
	  was killed in Alfarrobeira (1449) and whose achievements were then attributed 
	  to his brother Henry the Navigator, who was careful not to get involved in the quarrel. The war 
	  resumed against the Moroccans, who lost Alcacer Ceguer (present-day Ksar es-Seghir) [1458], Tangiers and 
	  Arzila (1471), Safi (1508) and Mazagan (1514); as an indirect consequence, Castile's push 
	  towards North Africa was deviated towards the east (Oran and Tlemcen region). But 
	  trade in Guinea was so profitable (gold, slaves, ivory, melagueta pepper, gum) that it was 
	  maintained by private initiative alone. In 1469, this traffic was leased to Fernao Gomes for an annual 
	  payment of 200 000 reis and the obligation to explore 100 leagues of coast every year beyond 
	  Sierra Leone; in 1474, the concession passed to Prince John, heir to the crown. 
	  The royalty was now pursuing a double aim: explore the islands and lands of the West and 
	  discover the sea route to India via South Africa. In the West, the Cape Verde Islands, discovered in 
	  1460, and the Azores served as a base for Portuguese journeys to near Newfoundland before 
	  Christopher Columbus, who made the most of their experiences. In Africa, 
	  the journey of 1471 was marked by the discovery of Sao Tomé and Annobon, and the crossing 
	  of the equator. King Alfonso V, fearing Castile's growing power just like his predecessors, 
	  ended his reign by vainly attempting to impose his rule in Castile by marrying Joan, the infanta 
	  of Castile, and heir apparent to Henry&nbsp;IV.</p>
      <p>John&nbsp;II (1481-1495) decided to subdue the nobility by executing the Dukes of Braganza (1483) and 
	  Viseu (1484). He methodically organised explorations and exploited the countries discovered. In Guinea 
	  (now Ghana), Diogo de Azambuja founded the fort of Sao Jorge da Mina (1482), 
	  which served as a stopover for later expeditions. From 1482, Diogo Cao knocked in Portuguese padroes 
	  (columns indicating a claim to ownership) in the present-day Democratic Republic of 
	  Congo and Cape Santa Maria in Angola. While Pêro da Covilha explored India and Ethiopia, 
	  Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Storms (known today as the Cape of Good Hope) and 
	  discovered the Indian Ocean (1487). Christopher Columbus, whom the King of Portugal had denied 
	  boats in 1484, returned from his first journey, flying the flag of Castile (1492-1493) and
	  announcing that he had reached India by the west. 
	  John II was still convinced that the best route was via the east, but in 1493, Pope Alexander
	  VI restricted the navigation zone, initially granted to Portugal by the papal bull issued by Pope Callistus III,
	  to the east of a meridian located 100 leagues from the Cape Verde Islands; the court of Lisbon, 
	  which valued the mysterious islands of the West, had the restriction pushed to 370 leagues 
	  west of the Cape Verde Islands (treaty of Tordesillas, 1494).</p>
      <p>It was during the reign of Manuel I the Fortunate (1495-1521) that Vasco de Gama 
	  completed the first sea journey to the Indies, though not without running into the 
	  hostility of the Muslim merchants, who until then had a monopoly on the transport of goods 
	  from the Far East to Europe, via Alexandria. Making the most of their superior ships 
	  and their artillery, the Portuguese punished the local sultanates, ruined the Muslims' trade 
	  and within a few yeas dominated the Indian Ocean by occupying the fortresses along the straits: 
	  Vasco de Gama bombarded Calicut (1502); Francisco de Almeida, appointed viceroy of Cochin, Cannanore and 
	  Quiloa, built forts along the African coast (1505) and destroyed the Egyptian fleet 
	  in Diu (1509); between 1507 and 1515, Albuquerque took Socotora, Mascate, Goa, Malacca and Ormuz. 
	  The Portuguese arrived in Malacca in 1509 to learn that the spices came from an archipelago 
	  to the east, the Moluccas, where they founded a trading post (Amboine) around 1512. 
	  Despite Magellan's presence (1521), the archipelago was established as Portugal's 
	  after the Treaty of Saragossa (1529). The Portuguese finished discovering Asia's markets 
	  by landing in Siam, Cambodia, Dai Viêt, China (1514 or 1517), Canton, where they received the 
	  Macao concession (1557), and Japan (1542).</p>
      <p>The sovereign then took the title of "King of Portugal and the Algarve" on both sides of the sea 
	  and "Lord of Guinea and the Conquest, Navigation and Trade of Ethiopia, Arabia and Persia" in Africa. 
	  He was represented by a viceroy in Goa and fully intended to profit from the discoveries; 
	  he entrusted the control of remote trade to a crown office, the Casa da Guiné, which took the name 
	  Casa da Guiné e Mina in 1482-1483 before being incorporated into the Casa da India e da Guiné (1499). 
	  The ships were grouped into fleets and left Lisbon in Easter, and sped along by the monsoon, they 
	  reached Calicut, Cochin and Goa in September; from these ports, other ships 
	  made their way to the spice markets of Malacca and Ternate, which other Portuguese 
	  were going to distribute to Japan, China and Persia, including the latest inventions of 
	  European technology (watches, arquebuses, cannons) and products from the newly founded metallurgical industry 
	  in Lisbon. The returning fleet guaranteed the King of Portugal a dominating position 
	  in the European market for Asian spices, sugar from the islands and black slaves. 
	  Outside its forts, Portugal did not have any land extended beyond the seas. 
	  But Portugal's activities were not merely trade-based; the Jesuits' 
	  missionary ventures (Saint Francis Xavier) and the attempts at forced conversion 
	  led to a scattering of small pockets of Christendom throughout the Far East and paved the way for 
	  the evangelisation of Japan and China; thanks to the Portuguese, the European civilisation 
	  made inroads into areas as varied as the Kingdom of Congo and the Japanese Empire.<br />
        The length of the journeys, which delayed the profits, the costs and especially 
		the impossible situation of trying to maintain a monopoly on the spice trade took a huge chunk out of the 
		King of Portugal's profits. The court of Lisbon stepped down efforts in the Far East, 
		began liquidating its Moroccan holdings (except Tangiers, Ceuta, Azemmour and Mazagan) 
		and shifted the focus back to its Atlantic land. 
		Sugar cane, for which Portugal had practically cornered the market, was running out of space 
		on the islands: Madeira, the Azores, Cape Verde and Sao Tomé; Portugal came across 
		an almost unlimited field for expansion in the country of the "Brazil wood", which was proclaimed
		Portuguese property by Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500. By order of John III, who 
		wanted to conceal it from French pirates, Martim Afonso de Sousa organised its colonisation 
		from Sao Vicente (1532). The Brazilian plantations enhanced the trade posts 
		in Guinea and then in Angola in the second half of the 16th century; the Portuguese 
		were practically the only ones to sell slaves and consequently 
		supplied their colonies and Spanish America, thereby earning the money required for trade in the 
		Far East.</p>
      <p>The intellectual and artistic culture (Manueline art) experienced the same boost 
	  as the economy and reached its golden age during the reign of John III (1521-1557), 
	  who received approval from Pope Paul III to establish the Jesuits in Portugal (1547), 
	  where they built their university in Evora, while the king permanently transferred 
	  Lisbon university to Coimbra (1537). Portugal became one of the centres 
	  for the Catholic Reformation. Despite the hostilities, the major Jewish community 
	  played a key role in both intellectual and economic circles.</p>

      <h3>The Rhinoceros of 1515</h3>
      <p>An Indian Rhinoceros, known as gomda, derived from the Indian term ganda. This rhinoceros 
	  was offered by King Muzaffar II of Cambay in India to Alfonso de Albuquerque in 1514, and was then 
	  sent to King Emmanuel I of Portugal in Lisbon, where it arrived on 20 May 1515. 
	  It was immediately identified as the rhinoceros mentioned by the Ancients and 
	  quickly became the star of the royal menagerie and the centre of interest among scientists.</p>
      <p>The rhinoceros became an overnight celebrity in Europe. A letter describing the animal, accompanied 
	  by a fairly accurate sketch, was sent to Nuremberg; since lost, this document was used by 
	  Albrecht D&uuml;rer for his drawing entitled RHINOCEROS 1515, followed by 
	  a famous woodcut entitled RHINOCERVS 1515. According to this same document, Hans Burgkmair completed 
	  a rather different woodcarving entitled RHINOCEROS MDXV, but which proved much less 
	  successful. According to a similar document received in Italy, Giovanni Giacomo Penni published 
	  a poemetto about the animal in Rome on 13 July 1515: Forma &amp; natura et costumi de lo rinoceron che stato condutto in Portogallo dal capitanio de larmata del re &amp; altre belle cose condutte dalle insule nouamente trouate.</p>
      <p>The rhinoceros had apparently been tamed and came to Lisbon with its Indian tamer, who looked after 
	  the animal. In May, King Emmanuel I had the animal parade along with other exotic animals 
	  during one or more processions through the streets of Lisbon, all without the slightest incident. 
	  On 3 June behind closed doors, the king organised a fight between the rhinoceros 
	  and one of his elephants: upon discovering its opponent, the elephant
	  ran for cover in its enclosure and the rhinoceros was declared winner by default. 
	  This chivalrous exploit was proclaimed throughout Europe.</p>
      <p>In December, Emmanuel I, who had already offered Hanno the elephant 
	  to Pope Leo X, decided to send him the rhinoceros with a luxurious embassy. The animal boarded the ship, 
	  which then set sail for If Island, off Marseille. On 24 January, the King of France, 
	  Francis I, travelled to the island with his court to see the rhinoceros; then the ship set sail again, 
	  but sank off Porto Venere, near La Spezia. The poor rhinoceros died in the shipwreck 
	  and we do not know exactly what happened to the body: according to the legend, the body 
	  was retrieved and the hide offered to the pope (though the Vatican officially denies 
	  having any rhinoceros skin in its secret archives).</p>
