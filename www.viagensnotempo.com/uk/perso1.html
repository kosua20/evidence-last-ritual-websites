      <h3>Alfonso I<span id="expo"></span> Henriques</h3>
	  <h4>(Guimaraes towards 1110 - Coimbra 1185)</h4>
      <p>Count of Lusitania (1112-1139), King of Portugal (1139-1185), the first sovereign of the 
	  Burgundian dynasty, son of Henry of Burgundy, Capetian prince and father of Sancho I<span id="expo"></span> 
	  of Portugal, his heir to the throne.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="story2">
      <br />	
      <h3><a href="#top"></a>Background</h3>
      <p>At the end of the 11th century, Iberian politics were highly influenced 
	  by the Reconquista: driving out the Moorish successor state to the Caliphate of Cordoba. 
	  As the military aristocracy was mainly focused on the Crusades, Alfonso VI of Castile 
	  called for help from the French nobility to deal with the Moors. In return, Alfonso VI was to give his 
	  daughters' hands to the expedition leaders and great privileges to the others.</p>
      <p>Consequently, the heiress Urraca of Castile married Raymond of Burgundy, the Duke of Burgundy's 
	  second son. Urraca's half-sister, Princess Teresa of Le&oacute;n, Alfonso VI's illegitimate daughter, 
	  married Henry of Burgundy, Raymond's uncle.<br />
        Through this alliance, Henry became Count of Portugal, a difficult fief 
		in the north of Castile, where Moorish attacks and incursions were not uncommon. 
		Teresa bore him a son, Alfonso Henriques (Henriques means "son of Henry").</p>
      <h3><a href="#top"></a>His Life </h3>
      <p>Alfonso's father, Henry of Burgundy, died when he was three, in the process inheriting 
	  the County of Portugal through his mother, a daughter of Castile, but not the dukedom 
	  of Burgundy which his father, second in line, had not acquired.</p>
      <p>In 1146, Alfonso Henriques married Mafalda of Savoy. Inheritance of the county 
	  was challenged by his mother, Teresa of Le&oacute;n, who wanted to keep the County of 
	  Portugal in the family of Le&oacute;n and under the allegiance of the family 
	  of Castile, which had granted her a deed for the vassal county, despite her 
	  illegitimate descent.</p>
      <p>However, according to Salic law, neither the mother, an illegitimate daughter, nor 
	  Alfonso Henriques (a descendant of Burgundy and whose county had only been obtained 
	  through marriage) could revert to either family (this was disputed by the family of Castile 
	  long after Portugal had become independent).</p>
      <p>Alfonso Henriques of Burgundy, Count of Portugal, was the first King of Portugal, whose independence 
	  was declared to the detriment of the Kingdoms of Le&oacute;n and Castile. 
	  Alfonso I<span id="expo"></span> of Portugal was proclaimed king on 26 July 1139 and was
	  known as the Conqueror during his reign for having extended and defended his kingdom 
	  against the Moors and for having won Portugal's independence from 
	  Castile. Mafalda of Savoy bore him seven children, including 
	  Sancho I of Portugal, his successor. He died on 6 December 1185 in Coimbra.</p>
      <h3><a href="#top"></a>His Achievements</h3>
      <p>Born in Coimbra, Alfonso Henriques might have been raised 
	  in Guimar&atilde;es, where he lived until 1128. In 1128 and under the guidance of 
	  the Archbishop of Braga, he took a political stance against his mother, 
	  who had sided with the Trava family, one of whose members was her lover. 
	  Forced into exile, the archbishop took Alfonso with him. Alfonso was dubbed 
	  a knight in 1122. After peace, he returned to the County of Portugal.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, new incidents incited King Alfonso VII of Castile to invade the county, surrounding
	  Guimar&atilde;es in 1127, where Alfonso Henriques had settled in order to 
	  assert his rights over the County of Portugal, the vassal of the Kingdom of Castile. 
	  Alfonso VII could count on the support of his illegitimate half-sister, 
	  to whom he contested the right to transfer the county deeds, which were to  
	  remain in the royal families of Le&oacute;n and Castile.</p>
      <p>Since Alfonso Henriques had promised him his loyalty, Alfonso VII gave up conquering the city. 
	  But a few months later in 1128, the royal troops led by Teresa of Le&oacute;n clashed with the army 
	  commanded by her son Alfonso Henriques of Burgundy, the Count of Portugal, who emerged victorious 
	  and asserted his authority over the Portuguese land by taking the county's government.</p>
      <p>The count then began focusing his efforts on gaining total independence for the Church of 
	  Portugal from the Holy See and Portugal's independence recognised 
	  by the King of Castile. In 1139, after a resounding victory over the Moors during the Battle of 
	  Ourique, Alfonso Henriques was acclaimed King of Portugal by his troops.</p>
      <p>The following year, he reasserted his claim to the southern part of Galicia, which stirred Alfonso 
	  VII of Castile into action. Both armies met at Arcos de Valdevez. The fate of the conflict was 
	  decided by a joust, which was won by the Portuguese knights.</p>
      <p>According to the tradition, independence was confirmed later in the Cort&egrave;s of Lamego, when 
	  the king personally received from the Archbishop of Braganza the gold crown and jewels of 
	  Portugal, as the successor of the Visigothic kings (although recent research 
	  has cast doubts on whether the Cortes meeting actually took place). The family of Castile 
	  recognised independence in 1143. All this resulted from Alfonso VII's ambition to become emperor 
	  of the entire Iberian peninsula, and that is why he needed kings as vassals of 
	  Le&oacute;n and Portugal.</p>
      <p>From that moment on, Alfonso I<span id="expo"></span> of Portugal sought to consolidate his 
	  country's independence. He made considerable donations to the Church and founded various 
	  convents. He tried to conquer land to the south from the Moors 
	  and took Santar&eacute;m in 1146 and Lisbon in 1147. In the depopulated 
	  areas won back from the Arabs, he set up colonists and invited 
	  military religious orders, such as the Knights Templar and the Hospitallers, 
	  to establish quarters along the borders as defenders 
	  against the Moors. In 1179, Pope Alexander III issued his papal bull, the <em>Manifestus probatum</em>, which 
	  recognised Portugal as an independent country and vassal of the Church, provided that he pay tribute 
	  to the pope.</p>

      <h3>The Mysterious Seal of Alfonso I<span id="expo"></span> Henriques</h3>
      <p>Alfonso I Henriques' first royal seal appears to conceal a message for the 
	  Knights Templar. The letters of the word "Portugal" are arranged in such a way as to 
	  spell &quot;Por Tuo Gral&quot;:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading from top to bottom and following the vertical line of the cross, 
		you can read POR. This word means FOR (or BY) in Portuguese.</li>
        <li>Next, in the upper part of the seal, three letters form the triangle TUO. The logical translation 
		is YOUR, but why not THUOT (TH&ocirc;T)? Well, Portuguese grammar does not let you place a 
		H after a T or a T at the end of a word.</li>
        <li>Finally, in the lower part of the seal, you can see the word GRAL, if you include the offset R; 
		once again, there are two meanings: it could be MORTAR (GRAL), the bowl used with a pestle to grind ingredients, 
		or the famous GRAIL, the cup that contained the blood of Christ. Both are recipients.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Another more widely known seal of the king splits the word PORTUGAL into the same three segments: 
	  POR TU G[R]AL, which again are divided by the famous Templar cross - this was actually the seal 
	  chosen to illustrate Portugal's 1, 2 and 5 cent (euros) coins.</p>
      <p>When you realise how fond the Knights Templar were of coded messages, King 
	  Alfonso I<span id="expo"></span> Henriques might have used this way to transform the name of his kingdom 
	  into a motto that they cherished: POR TUO GRAL! For your Grail!</p>
