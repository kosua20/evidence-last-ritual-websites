      <h3>Gualdim Pais</h3>
	  <h4>(Braga 1118 - Tomar 1195)</h4>
      <p>Dom Gualdim Pais (Gaudinus, Galdinus or Gualdinus in Latin), a Grand Master of 
	  the Order of the Temple in Portugal from 1157 to 1195, founded Tomar Castle.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="story2">
      <br />	
      <h3>His Life</h3>
      <p>Gualdim Pais, son of Paio Ramires and Gontrode Soares, was born in the Minho province 
	  in the north of Braga in 1118.</p>
      <p>He was raised in the Santa Cruz Monastery in Coimbra and very early on entered the service 
	  of the future king, Alfonso Henriques, whom he assisted with his brothers in arms, the knights 
	  Mem Remires and Martin Monis, in all the fighting that had to be waged against the Moors 
	  to conquer the kingdom. He made a name for himself during the conquest of Santarem in 1147, followed 
	  by Lisbon in 1149, before heading off to Palestine, where he took part in the Siege of Gaza in 1153.</p>
	  <p>His appearance, his great warrior-like presence and his leadership qualities 
	  simply added to the prestige that he had gained through his remarkable skills as a fighter 
	  and organiser. His stay in the East put the finishing touches to his already confirmed military experience, 
	  and when he returned from the Crusades, he knew exactly what mission was waiting for him. In 1157, 
	  he was appointed the fourth Grand Master of the Order of the Temple in Portugal, which at the time was
	  based in Braga.</p>
    <div class="story3"> <img src="../pics/alcobaca.jpg" alt="Alcobaça Abbey" width="200" height="200" vspace="4" />
      <h3>The Vision of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux</h3>
      <p>A few years earlier, while Alfonso Henriques was preparing for the famous Battle of Santarem, 
	  Saint Bernard told Gualdim Pais that the Blessed Virgin had come to him in a dream 
	  to reveal that the king would be victorious.</p>
	  <p>The king immediately vowed to offer Clairvaux all the land and subsidies required 
	  to build an immense abbey if he did indeed win the decisive battle. His wish granted, the king 
	  kept his promise and Saint Bernard went to Alcobaça in person, accompanied by 
	  five monks-architects responsible for determining the land needed for the Foundation, the first stone of which 
	  was laid by the young sovereign himself.</p>
	  <p>But building a monastery in such an outlying location called for a high level of military protection, 
	  so the king appointed the Knights Templar, who already owned a few 
	  castles in the area. As a reward, the king donated all the land between Santarem and Tomar to the 
	  Order of the Temple. Gualdim Pais was responsible for building the defensive ring, which was to 
	  enclose Clairvaux's possessions as well as bolster the protection of the Portuguese lines against 
	  Arab incursions.</p>
    </div>
	  <p>In 1160, Gualdim Pais financed the construction of the Convent of Christ and Tomar Castle, 
	  which served as the headquarters of the Knights Templar in Portugal; he took up residence there 
	  in 1162. He was also behind the construction of the Castles of Almourol, Idanha, Ceres, Castelo Branco, 
	  Monsanto and Pombal. He settled in Pombal in 1174.</p>
	  <p>In 1190, Tomar was attacked by the Almoravids under the King of Morocco, Yusuf I, but 
	  Gualdim Pais and his vastly outnumbered knights managed to defend the castle against the attacking forces, 
	  thereby preventing the north of the kingdom from being invaded.</p>
      <p>He died in Tomar during 1195 (1233 according to the Spanish Era). His body lies in the <strong>Church of 
	  Santa Maria do Olival</strong> in Tomar, where a <strong>wall stele</strong> conceals a recess 
	  containing the knight's ashes. </p>

	  <p>Through his personal qualities of bravery, his tireless actions and his achievements, 
	  Gualdim Pais was the epitome of a Knight Templar, whose memory continues to be cherished 
	  in Portugal. He also represents the perfect initiate, capable of working with foresight for the future of his 
	  country, whereby his successors will merely need to finish what he started.</p>

      <h3>The Establishment of the Order of the Temple in Portugal </h3>
      <p>Barely two months after the founder of the Order of the Temple had appeared before the Council 
	  of Troyes - which was to play a key role in the recognition and development of the order - 
	  one of his companions received the order's first major donation from Portugal. 
	  On 19 March 1128, Queen Teresa, Count Henry's widow and guardian 
	  of their son Alfonso, granted Soure Castle and its outbuildings to the Temple. Other donations 
	  quickly came pouring in. They were not necessarily from powerful lords, 
	  but many donations were made. For example, between 1128 and 1130, 19 properties, including 
	  several rural estates, were fully or partly received by the Temple. In June 1145, Sancha, the daughter 
	  of Queen Teresa, and her husband gave Longrovia Castle in Portuguese 
	  Estramadura to the Temple, as well as several outbuildings in Braga. That same year, Archbishop John of Braga 
	  granted the order a house, a hospital for pilgrims and half of the city's church revenue, including 
	  the tithes. At the same time, the Knights Templar pursued an active acquisition policy, 
	  which tied in with the piety of the faithful, 
	  whose testaments were both regular and considerable.</p>
      <h4>Permanent Presence of the Knights Templar in Portugal from 1143</h4>
      <p>The first tangible signs of the Order of the Temple's permanent presence 
	  in the kingdom date back to 1143, which is when a French Knight Templar, Hugues de Martone, was 
	  appointed Procurator of the Temple in Portugal. The following year, the small Templar 
	  garrison at Soure Castle was defeated during a skirmish with the Moorish troops in 
	  Santarem. In 1147, the Knights Templar exacted their revenge by taking part in the capture of the 
	  city, and in reward for their hard work, the king gave the order the right 
	  to receive all the religious taxes collected in Santarem.</p>
      <p>At the end of the 1150s, under the rule of Gualdim Pais, the fourth Grand Master 
	  of the Temple in Portugal, the order's extraordinary growth began. During the decade, the king gave the Temple 
	  a sizable piece of farming land where the rivers Nabao and Zezere flow together; the order used the land 
	  to build Tomar Castle, which became the headquarters of the Temple in Portugal, followed by its successor, 
	  the Order of Christ. About 10 years later, as part of a decision to grant vast swathes of land south of the 
	  Tagus but which went unheeded, the king insisted that the order's resources only be used in the kingdom, especially 
	  for pursuing the <em>Reconquest</em>.</p>
