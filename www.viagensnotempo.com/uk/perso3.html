      <h3>Denis I<span id="expo"></span> of Portugal</h3>
	  <h4>(Lisbon 1261 - Odevilas 1325)</h4>
      <p>Denis of Portugal, nicknamed the <em>Farmer, Father of the Homeland</em> and even the <em>Liberal</em>, 
	  was the second son of King Alfonso III and his infante wife Beatrice of Castile (1242-1303), becoming 
	  the sixth King of Portugal in 1279 (and the fifth King of the Algarve) instead of his older brother Robert, 
	  who had been declared the illegitimate son of Mahaut of Dammartin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="story2">
      <br />	
      <h3>His Reign</h3>
      <p>As heir to the throne, Denis I<span id="expo"></span> was trained at an early age 
	  by his father to manage Portugal. When he ascended to the throne, Portugal was again 
	  in conflict with the Catholic Church. Denis tried to resolve the problem by signing 
	  a treaty with Pope Nicholas III, promising to protect Rome's interests in Portugal, particularly 
	  by granting asylum to the Order of the Temple, persecuted in France, under the name of the Order 
	  of Christ (see inset below). </p>
      <p>With the Reconquista at an end, Denis I<span id="expo"></span> was mainly an administrative, pacific 
	  king, despite minor conflicts with Castile, from which he gained possession 
	  of the villages of Serpa and Moura, the land beyond Guadiana and the rectification 
	  of the borders of Ribacoa. He signed a border treaty with Ferdinand IV of Castile on 
	  12 September 1297. This treaty is still in force today. Once this problem had been dealt with, 
	  no other wars broke out during his reign, thereby justifying the memory that he left behind 
	  of a king that was strangely peace-loving for his era.</p>
      <p>As such, the government's priorities were mainly to organise the country and 
	  pursue his father's policies. Denis published the crux of Portugal's
	  civil and criminal law, and focused on protecting the least fortunate classes 
	  against the misuse of power.</p>
      <p>During his reign, he travelled around the country, visiting the towns and 
	  resolving any problems. With the help of his wife, Queen Elizabeth of Aragon, known as Saint Elizabeth 
	  (1271-1336), Denis tried to improve the lot of the poor and founded various charity institutions.</p>
      <p>Preoccupied with the country's infrastructure, Denis ordered the copper, 
	  silver, tin and iron mines to be worked, and exported the products 
	  to other European countries. He signed the first trade agreement with England in 
	  1308 and founded the Portuguese merchant navy.</p>
      <p>Denis introduced Portugal's first land reform, redistributed the land by dividing up the 
	  feudal and church lands, encouraged agriculture and founded various rural communities, markets 
	  and fairs. During his reign, Portugal produced more cereal than required and exported 
	  the surplus. One of his greatest achievements was planting a pine forest 
	  to protect the arable land from the advancing coastal sand.</p>
      <p>Denis created a merchant navy for trading with Catalonia, Brittany, England and Scandinavia. 
	  By establishing Genoese merchants in Lisbon, he promoted skilled sailors and had navigators 
	  come from neighbouring countries. The Azores were apparently first discovered 
	  during his reign.</p>
      <p>Denis I<span id="expo"></span> put Portugal on an equal footing 
	  with the other kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula.</p>
      <p>Culture was another of his centres of interest. Denis was keen on literature and even 
	  penned a few books himself on such topics as administration, hunting and poetry. 
	  In 1290, he founded the University of Lisbon, which he moved to Coimbra in 1307. 
	  His decree, the <em>Magna Charta Priveligiorum</em>, founded the University 
	  of Coimbral and defended the use and teaching of Latin instead of Portuguese.</p>
      <p>However, the last few years of his reign were marked by infighting between his two sons: 
	  Alfonso, the legitimate heir, and Alfonso Sanches, the Count of Albuquerque and illegitimate son.</p>
      <h3>Family Tree</h3>
      <p>Through his marriage in 1282 with Elizabeth of Aragon, or Saint Elizabeth, (1271-1336):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Constance (3 January 1290 - 18 November 1313), who married Ferdinand IV, the King of Castile</li>
        <li>Alfonso IV of Portugal (1291-1357), his successor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With Maria Pires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>John Alfonso (1288-1336), Lord of Lous&atilde; and Arouse</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With Marinha Gomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maria Alfonso, who married Jo&atilde;o of Lacerda, a Castilian noble</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With Aldon&ccedil;a Rodrigues Telha:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alfonso Sancho (1289-1329), Count of Albuquerque and rival of Alfonso IV</li>

      <h3>From the Order of the Temple to the Order of Christ</h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h4>Abolition of the Order of the Temple</h4>
      <p>On 30 December 1308, while the case of the Knights Templar had already been a burning issue in 
	  France over the past year, the pope ordered King Denis of Portugal to arrest the Knights Templar 
	  under his jurisdiction. A
	  commission of enquiry was created in the country and was chaired by the Bishop of 
	  Lisbon and attended by the superior of the Franciscan Order and a jurist, Joao de Luis. 
	  28 knights were then questioned, as well as six other witnesses. To prevent the Temple's possessions 
	  from falling into other hands, the king ordered the possessions to be confiscated in January 
	  1310, until such time as the Church had officially reached a verdict concerning the accused order. 
	  The enquiry conducted in Portugal, though without resorting to torture, could not find
	  any blame concerning the Temple or its members, and a provincial council 
	  held shortly after to decide on any follow-ups came to the same conclusion.</p>
      <h4>Creation of the Order of Christ</h4>
      <p>King Denis was worried about the rumours that the pope was apparently 
	  thinking of awarding all the Temple's possessions to the Hospitallers. The Hospitallers already 
	  owned several possessions on the south bank of the Tagus, and giving them the Templar holdings on the north 
	  bank of the same river would provide them with such a build-up in what was a strategic area that 
	  they would undoubtedly be capable of undermining the royal 
	  authority. After various negotiations, the king obtained the ruling in 1319 whereby the Temple's 
	  possessions would go to a new, specifically Portuguese order.</p>
      <p>The bull of foundation <em>Ad ea ex quibus</em> granted by Pope John XXII on 
	  14 March 1319 first proclaimed the creation of a new order called the "Order 
	  of the Knights of Christ" (<em>Ordem de Cavalaria de N. S. Jesus Cristo</em>) and 
	  established the fortress of Castro Marim as the knights' house in the south-easternmost part of the country, 
	  at the mouth of the Guadiana. 
	  Then it imposed the rule of Calatrava on the new brotherhood and appointed 
	  Dom Gil Martins as Grand Master, the previous Grand Master of the Order of Aviz. 
	  It transferred all the possessions and rights of the Knights Templar 
	  to the new militia, but placed it under the eminent authority of the Cistercian abbot 
	  of Alcoba&ccedil;a Monastery, in the diocese of Lisbon. The abbot was therefore 
	  entitled to visit and correct all the houses belonging to the Order of Christ. 
	  Each master of the order had to pledge his loyalty to the abbot, 
	  ultimately representing the Supreme Pontiff. Finally, should the master's position be left vacant, 
	  the bull stipulated that the new master should be someone both military and religious, and specifically 
	  professed by the new order. Unfortunately, the following century, this protective framework 
	  could not hold up against the greediness of the Portuguese sovereigns, 
	  attracted to the order's considerable wealth.</p>
      <h4>The Order of Christ - a Resurgence of the Order of the Temple</h4>
      <p>Historians believe that the Order of Christ was the main refuge for the Knights Templar 
	  that escaped the spate of arrests on 13 October 1307 in France; the new Portuguese order 
	  became the (only?) resurgence of the Order of the Temple. Most of the Knights Templar 
	  arrived in Portugal by sea, since part of the Templar fleet, that had left La Rochelle to avoid being 
	  commandeered, dropped anchor in the port of Serra d'El-Rei, a port stronghold built by 
	  Gualdim Pais, which has since disappeared. As a result, the Order of Christ 
	  inherited the Templars' knowledge in terms of construction and maritime navigation. 
	  It was used a century later by the infante Henry the Navigator, the governor of the Order of Christ, 
	  to develop his famous caravel, whose sails proudly flew the Templar cross, and later still by 
	  Christopher Columbus, who was also a Grand Master of the Order of Christ.</p>
